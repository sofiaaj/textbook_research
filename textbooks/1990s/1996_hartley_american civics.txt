Describe America's earnest immigrants. 1 Explain changes in U.S. immigration policy since the early 1800s. 3. Name the two ways that a person can be a U.S. citizen by I birth. 4. Compare the rights of U.S. citizens and legal aliens, and identify the problems of illegal aliens. Teaching Section 2 Building a Vocabulary Have a volunteer define immigrants, (people who came herefrom other lands) Then ask them why some immigrants are called refugees: (They come to acountryfor refuge; they are fleeing persecution in their homeland.) Ask whether anyone can name the process by which immigrants become citizens, (naturalization) Then ask than what they think native-born citizens are. (Native-born citizens are those citizens born in this country.) Who Are US. Citizens? America's heritage of freedom and equality was formed bit by bit as groups from various parts of the world settled here. Today all Americans can be proud of the background we share. For we are all immigrants—people who came here from other lands—or descendants of immigrants. From their countries of origin, immigrants brought different languages, ideas, beliefs, customs, hopes, and dreams. These d ifferent ways of life mixed with the ideas and ways of life of those already present in America. This multicultural heritage has given a special energy and richness to American society that would not be possible otherwise. Early mericans As you know from your study of American history, the first people to settle in America were the Native Americans. Archaeologists —scientists who study the remains of past cultures—estimate that the ancestors of modern-day [Native Americans came here from Siberia in Asia between 12,000 and 60,000 years ago. Gradually, over thousands of years, they moved into many parts of North, Central, and South America. The Vikings came next but did not stay long. The Spaniards were the first Europeans to build lasting settlements in the Americas. They settled in Mexico, Central and South America, and what are now Florida, California, Texas, and the southwestern United States. The original 13 colonies were settled mostly by people from England. Colonists from other countries included German settlers the Dutch along the Hudson River, and the Swedes in New Jersey and Delaware. Many black people also came to America from Africa. Unlike other immigrants, most of them were brought to America as slaves. They and their children were forced to live in bondage for many The Americas As you know, citizens of the United States are called Americans. What you may not know is that our neighbors to the north and south could be called Americans, too After all, the two continents that make up the Western Hemisphere are North America and South America. Why, then, do the people of Canada, or Mexico, or Brazil not call themselves Americans? The reason is that the United States was the first independent nation in the hemisphere. By the time Mexico and the other nations achieved independence in the 1800s, the "American" label already had a specific m eaning. It meant a citizen of the United States. U.S. Immigration Polic Over the years, the United States has been settled and populated by people fran all over the world. During its early histcry, the new American nation struggled to survive. As a result, most immigrants were welcomed to the United States. Agricultural workers and factcry laborers, for example, were needed as the nation expanded from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. As a result, during the first half of the 1800s, the U.S. government adopted an "open-shore" policy. This policy allowed unlimited immigration to the United States. The only persons who were not admitted to the country were criminals and those who had certain diseases. European newcomers to the American colonies included groups other than Christians. Several sizable Jewish settlements also existed in colonial America. The first such settlement was in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (now New York) in 1654. Groups of Jews also settled in Newport, Rhode Island (by 1678), and Savannah, Georgia (1733), among other locations. In 1800 the 600 Jews of Charleston, South Carolina, comprised the largest Jewish population of any U.S. Chapter 1 We the People 7 Dramatizing Government Pair up students who take turns playing the roles of an alien applying for citizenship and an immigration official. Ask students to write questions the immigration official might ask, as well as possible answers. Have one volunteer pair present a dramatization to the class. (You might set up a mock immigration office.) Have the dass discuss each character's goals and concerns in the exchange. Divide the dass into small groups. Have some group members make up characteristics of hypothetical immigrants (such as age, education, health, criminal record (if any], and years of U.S. residency). Other group members should ask questions to determine whether or not the immigrant may become a naturalized citizen. Have members record which immigrants are approved for citizenship, which are not, and why. Have a volunteer from each group present one "immigrant case" for the class to discuss. Gr Perspectives Point out that many immigrants to the United States throughout the country's history have been refugees trying to escape from world trouble spots. Refugees are a major part of the massive movement of people throughout the world. In fact, some officials put the total number of refugees in the world in 1992 at 17 million. Some reports indicate that five million were displaced during the 1990- 1991 Persian Gulf conflict alone. The massive number of refugees throughout the world is a major financial and logistical burden for the world community. As America began to fill and land and jobs became less available, however, some Americans wanted to change the immigration policy. Slowly the United States began to limit the number of people who were allowed to immigrate to this country. During the 1880s the government placed sane restrictions on immigration. It was not until the 1920s, however, that a quota, a limit, was established on the number of immigrants who could be admitted to the nation each year. U.S. immigration policy today is guided by the Immigration Act of 1990. Under this act the cap on immigration fa 1995 and beyond was set at 675,000 immigrants a year—up considerably from the annual figure of 290,000 established in 1965. Preference is given to immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and to persons who have valuable employment skills. Refugees, or persons fleeing persecution in their home countries, are not subject to this annual quota. In recent years the majority of immigrants to the United States have come from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean islands. Many of these people immigrated to the United States to escape wars and political conflicts in their countries. C\ Birth Millions of immigrants have become U.S. citizens. Some citizens belong to families that have lived here for many generations. Other Americans were born in foreign countries. All citizens, regardless of their heritage, have the same legal rights and responsibilities. Americans gain their citizenship either by birth a by a special legal process. Most of us became citizens of the United States by birth. If you were born in any one of the 50 states or in any U.S. territory, you automatically became a native-ban citizen. If one or both of your parents were U.S. citizens, you were a Unit IA Tradition of Democracy Guided Practice Refer students to the map on pages 520-521. Have students use what they know from the news to list those countries near the United States from which many legal and illegal immigrants have come. Explain that difficult economic and/or political conditions in certain nearby countries are some of the reasons for this immigration. Have students debate what they believe U.S. immigration policy should be regarding these countries. Independent Practice Have students find out when their ancestors (or those of a friend or a famous American) entered this country and from where they came. Students should use classroom and library resources to research conditions in the country of origin of their ancestors when the ancestors emigrated. Then have each student take the role of one of the immigrants and write personal journal entries describing the feelings he or she has about immigrating to the United States. citizen by birth even if they were living in a foreign land when you were bcm. Citizenship, then, can be acquired by the place of birth or through one's parents. What about children bcm in this country whose parents are citizens of a foreign country! Are they citizens of the United States? In most cases they are, if their parents were under the authority of the United States at the time the children were born What about children born here whose parents are officials representing a foreign country? They are not U.S. citizens because their parents are under the authority of another country. All cases involving claims of U.S. citizenship are handled by the U.S. Department of Justice. Aliens in the United States More than 20 million people living in the United States are citizens of other countries. These people are called aliens. Some of these people are here on a visit. Others live and work here or attend school but expect someday to return to their hanelands. Many other aliens in the United States expect to live in the country permanently. While in the United States, all aliens must obey the laws of this country. They are also entitled to be protected by its laws. Aliens enjoy most of the benefits of U.S. citizenship. They cannot, however, vote or hold public office. In addition, various state laws prohibit aliens fran working at certain jobs, such as teaching in public schools. All aliens living in the United States must register with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Sendee, an agency of the Department of Justice. They also must keep the agency informed of their current address. Illegal Hie ns No one knows exactly how many aliens live in the United States illegally, but estimates range from 3 million to 12 legalize the status of illegal aliens who meet certain requirements, but the flow of illegal immigration remains high. More than half the illegal aliens come from Mexico. Most come to the United States to find work and a better life. Life is often difficult fer illegal aliens, however. Many become migrant workers, moving from farm to farm picking crops. Illegal aliens often have to work for very low wages under harsh working conditions. Some citizens resent these aliens, who they believe are taking jobs away from U.S. citizens. Illegal aliens also face the danger of being caught and deperted, or forced to leave, the United States. Many aliens who immigrate to the United States hope to obtain a permanent residence visa, or "green card," which allows them to live in the country indefinitely. Despite its name, the prized green card is no longer green. It is a white card ah out the size of a credit card. By learning English, these aliens are taking an importantstep toward becoming U.S. citizens. What other steps must aliens take to become citizens of the United States? Photo Caption Answer declare intent (optional), file a petition, pass an examination, appear at a hearing to take oath of allegiance Chapter 1 We the People Closure Draw a chart on the chalkboard, with the following column headings: Native-Born Citizen, Legal Alien, Illegal Alien, Naturalized Citizen.

The legal process b^^vhich an alien may becane a citizen is calletiUiaturalization. The first part of the naturalization process is entering the United States legall To be eligible No enter the country, foreigners must prove that they can support themselves and that they om read and write. They must prove they do rto have certain diseases cr a mental illness and ate net drug addicts or criminals. There are several other restrictions that bar people from entering the United States. One restriction bars persons who favor violent revolution, that is, the overthrow of the government by force. Only immigrants or aliens admitted as permanent residents may become American citizens. This rule excludes foreign visiters and students and ethers who do net plan to stay in the United States. Although not required, immigrants may file a "declaration of intention," stating that they plan to become citizens. Some employers ask for this document as evidence that the employee plans to stay in the country. Aliens may apply for citizenship after they have lived in this country fer five years. This period is reduced to three years for an glien married to an American citizen. Aliens jst be at least 18 years old to apply for iship in the United States. first step is to fill out an application called a\{petition for naturalization." When immigratioiN authorities receive this application, th^v set a date for the person to appear before ^naturalization official for a hearing. During the heanqg the applicant must show that he or she is a person of good moral character who believes in tSe principles of the U.S. Constitution. The appiteint also must prove that he or she can read, white, and speak English acceptably and is familiaMyith U.S. history and government. After the examination the applicant files the petition^ naturalization in a naturalization court. Before they become citizens, applicants be investigated to check their' qualifications. If they prove to have the background needed to becane citizens, they are calledUo court for a final hearing. There they take ah^oath of allegiance to the United States and granted a certificate of naturalization. Children automatically become citizens when thei\parents' naturalization is officially completed. Naturalized citizensSaave the same rights and duties as native-born /toiericans.

Understand the diversity of America's population. Teaching Section 3 Building a V o cabulary Have students describe their image of atypical rural area and a typical urban area. Explain that rural comes from a Latin word meaning "open land." Have students use dictionaries to determine the word origin of urban, (comes from a Latin word meaning "city ") Then ask students whether a suburb is a mix of rural and urban or something completely different. Break suburb into its Latin parts: sub-, meaning "near," and -mbs, meaning "city." Section 2 Review ..

This infcrmation is used for many purposes, including to determine how many people fran each state will be elected to Congress. The census also tells us a great deal about the United States and the people who live here. For example, it tells us how many children there are in each family and how many people have moved and where. In addition, the census indicates the rate of population growth in the United States. This and other infcrmation gathered by census takers helps the government, businesses, and individuals plan x>r the future. It also helps us learn something jut ourselves and our nation. What are the two ways that a person becomes a citizen of the United States |)y birth? What rights do U.S. citizens have that legal alien s do n ot? What problems do illegal aliens face? Thinking Critically You have just become a naturalized citizen of the United States. Write a letter to a friend in the country in which you were born explaining why and how you became a U.S. citizen. The American People Today The leaders who planned the American government realized that they would need to know haw many people—citizens as well as 0®tizens m the nation. They decided that every 10 years the national government would make In official count ofthe number of people living in the United States. This count is called a census >t recent census w taken in 1990. Populai When the census takers counted the nation's population in 1790, they reported fewer than four million people living in the original 13 states. Sitee that time, the nation has grown in both size and population. Instead of 13 states, there are noi^30. And, according to current projections, the moon's population will exceed 268 million by theysar 2000. How did the United States grow to it^resent size and population? All nations grow in three ways. (Jhe way is by natural increase in population. A natural population increase occurs when the birthrate greater than the death rate. The birthrate refersS to the annual number of live births per 1,000 members of a population. The death rate refers to the annual number of deaths per 1,000 members of a country's population. The second way a nation grows is by adding new territory. The United States has gained new areas of land through war, purchase, and annexation. The people living in these new lands have added to the size of the country's population. The third source of population growth is immigration, or the arrival of people from (continued on page 14) Today the census contains very detailed information about the population of a given country or region. Until about the seventeenth century, however, many governments used censuses for more limited purposes. Many census officials in earlier societies were selective hi determining who should be counted and why. For example, governments primarily wanted to know who should be taxed, or who was available for work and military training. Consequently, certain societal groups, such as property owners and males, were more important than others to the census takers. Chapter 1 We the People ustrating Ideas re students use newspapers and other periodicals to cre- collages illustrating the reasons for population growth, example, students might use articles about birthrates or :ures of maternity wards to illustrate natural increases in ulation. Use the collages to prompt a discussion on the wrtance of accurate censuses. For example, students jht say rapidly increasing birthrates mean increasing mbers of children and subsequent needs to improve and arge educational facilities. ooperative Learning Have small groups of students create sketch maps showing how the U.S. population has gradually shifted westward over time. Some groups may want to show the location of large cities at different points in U.S. history, for example, while other groups might want to create maps showing the most populous states at various points in time. Each group member should use classroom and library resources (such as almanacs and encyclopedias) to find population information for specific states and cities or for specific Jv r C IVICS 4 SlDELIGH i help students visualize how e population of the United States has shifted over time, explain how the country's center of Population has moved. The center of population is the point at which a flat, weightless map of the country would balance if weights of identical value were laced on it so that each weight represented the location of one person. In 1790 the U.S. center X p opulation was 23 miles east >f Baltimore, Maryland. As Americans moved westward, so lid the center of the population, in 1900 the center of population was six miles southeast of Columbus, Indiana. In 1990 the country's center of population was 9.7 miles southeast of Steelville, Missouri. Sjther lands. Since 1820 more than 59 million grants from all over the world have come to the Umted States. As you know, the United States has been called a nation of immigrants. \How AmeHwi's Population Grew As the United States expanded from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific coast, i^ieeded a rapidly growing population to settle the rand. In the early years of the natiorN however, the population grew relatively slov Life was\ery difficult\n those early pioneer days, and tntaleath rate of/taiericans was high. Many infants anttahildren died, sjsease was common, and there werofew doctors. Little was known about diseases ana\how to cureNhem. Although some Americans ln*ecl to an old age, disease, poor diet, and the hazSrds of pionet living made the average life expectahQ1 short. Between 1790 and 1830 the population of the nation more than tripled, reaching nearly 13 million. Almost all of this growth was theVesult of births in the United States. It was common ibr families to have as many as 10 to 12 children^ Large families were a necessity at this time. Most people lived on farms, and large families were needed to help work the farms. Thus even though many children died young and the death rate was high, the population grew significantly. Beginning in the 1830s large numbers of immigrants started to arrive in the United States. Between 1830 and 1840 almost 600,000 immigrants came, mainly from Ireland. Over the next 10 years more than a million and a half new immigrants arrived. The population had reached 23 million by 1850. By 1920 the nation's population had risen to nearly 106 million. Immigrants from many lands, particularly the countries of southern and eastern Europe, accounted fer a large part of this increase in total population. As you have read, however, after 1920 the United States began to limit the number of immigrants admitted into the country each year. Most of the population growth after this time was due to natural increase. Today 's Population Growth Today the population of the United States continues to grow, although not as rapidly as in the past. In 1970, for example, 203 million people lived in the nation—nearly 24 million more than in 1960. By 1980, however, a new trend had appeared. Although the population increased by 23 million, this represented a change of only 11 percent since 1970. This was the second smallest increase in any 10-year period since 1790. Population projections indicate that the rate of increase will continue to drop, falling to 7 percent by the year 2000. One reason the U.S. population is growing at a slower rate is that lany people are having smalls' families. A iteople on the Move where do the people d^he United States live? The first census found mostwAmericans living on farms, with a smaller numTta living in villages and in a few (edium-sized >dties. Over the years this changed. The fatal population has become smallta every year. Irta991 fewer than 5 million people rhged on farms intale United States. Beginbmg in the 180wr Americans began to move away fmn rural areas AST regions of farms and small townfcs Most of thentavent to live in urban areas, or cities, to work intaactories and offices. As early as 18^0, the census allowed that urban areas were growing faster than rubri areas. With each new censusXthe proportion of Americans living in or near xjties continuectao grow. By 1920 the census shewed that more Americans lived in urban areasNjjan in rural ' areas. As the population continued to growrapidly and people moved to the cities, urbanWeas became crowded.

Congress 1 has trn power to govern the nation's territcries and to provide fcr the admission of new states. I Congress also has the power to regulate immigration and to pass naturalization laws. Naturalization laws make it possible for aliens to become U.S. citizens. Powers Qr anted to Congress Article l, Section 8, of the Constitution lists the powers granted to Congress. As you know, these powers are called delegated powers because they are granted, or delegated, to Congress by the Constitution. Delegated powers give Congress the right to make laws in five important areas. Financing Government Congress can raise and collect taxes, borrow money, and print and coin money. It can use the funds it collects to pay the debts of the United States and to provide for the nation's defense and for the general welfare. Regulating and Encouraging U.S. Trade and Industry Congress can regulate trade with foreign nations and among the states. It can also help U.S. businesses by setting a uniform standard of weights and measures and by passing laws that protect the rights of inventors. Congress also establishes post offices and builds roads that help business and industry in the nation. Congress can set 10UNlT2The Federal Government The Elastic Clause The last power listed in Section 8 of Article 1 is among the most important and far-reaching. It states that Congress has the power "to make "alTTaws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution [carrying out) the foregoing powers." This statement is the necessary and proper clause, also called the elastic clause. Itia called the elastic clause because it allows Congress .to stretch the delegated powers listed in the Constitution to cover many other subjects. The clause has permitted Congress to pass laws on situations that developed long after the Constitution was written. For example, Congress has set up national military academies to train army, navy, and air force officers. The Constitution does not specifically give Congress this power. Congress, however, argues that the academies are "necessary and proper" fcr it to carry out its constitutional right to establish an army and a navy. Congress claims that this clause of the U.S. Constitution implies, or suggests, that Guided Practice Refer students to the chart of executive departments on page 107.

V Rich Cultural Heritage is you learned in Chapter 1, people from all srer the world have settled in the United itates and contributed to its heritage. As group group came to the United States, they with them different languages, ideas, customs. Almost every language in the is spoken somewhere in the United The holidays, foods, elefhing, and ether of the many groups in U.S. society a richness to the lives of all Americans. The nation's many different groups are of their varied backgrounds. Sometimes, ter, differences in customs and beliefs led to misunderstandings and problems ;n groups. Such miscommunication and conflict has occurred not only in this country but in every land throughout history. Minority Qroups Some groups of people in society are referred to as minority groups. The word minority in this case does not necessarily mean that the group is outnumbered. Rather, it means that it is not the group in power. It also means that the group is set apart from other groups of people in society because of ethnic background, language, customs, or religion. Minority groups often have met with rejudice and discrimination. As you recall, prejudice is an opinion not based on a careful and reasonable review of facts. Discrimination refers oa unfair actions taken against people because o*ey belong to a particular group. Prejudice antidiscrimination have been present throughout humqn histcry. In the United States, too, some Americans have looked at those who were d ifferent from tHem with fear and distrust. Prejudice and dnerimination were not uncommon in the early ye*rs of the nation. For example, Native AmericansSvere often treated harshly by the settlers fror\Europe. Some English settlers did not welcome the early Scotch-Irish and Germans. In later years sane Americans feared arriving Catholics from Ireland and Germany. Still later, some purple opposed the arrival of immigrants southern and eastern Europe. Throughout the nation's histcry, African Americans have suffered greatly as a result of prejudice and discrimination. Also, Mexican Americans, other Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans often have faced resentment and hostility. The minority groups you have been reading about are ethnic groups. An ethnic group is a group of people of the same race, nationality, or religion who share a common and distinctive culture and heritage. In recent years women, older Americans, and people with physical and mental disabilities also have been regarded as minority Perspectives v ■B story provides many examples Inflicts among ethnic groups living within the same borders. The Roman Empire, however, managed to establish unity throughout its vast territory by offering many conquered peoples a valuable reward for their loyaltyi\ citizenship. People from laiiH^ distant as Syria, Britain, and S|K could all declare, "Civis romanus sum." ("I am a Rom an citizen.") Citizens throughout the empire received the same rights accorded those in Rome, and they received the protection of the Roman army and the highly regarded Roman legal system. They also gained economic opportunities and access to government jobs. Although these liberal citizenship laws surely did not eh min ate all hostility among the empire's conquered peoples, some historians point to them as one reason the empire lasted as long as it did.
