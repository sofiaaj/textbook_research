Between 1840 and 1860, an averageof more than 200,000 immigrants reachedAmerican shores each year. The reasons forthis migration were both political and eco-nomic. Thousands of English, Irish, Scandi-navian, and Dutch farmers and workersmade the often perilous voyage to escapepoverty and starvation. Others, like Germanthinkers and writers, came to avoid politicalpersecution. By 1860, about one out of everyeight Americans was foreign-born.Some established Americans resentedimmigrants with their different languages,religions, and customs. Such bigotry wasaccompanied by the fear that immigrantswould bring new and radical political ideasinto the United States.

CHAPTER 9An Urban Society1860-1900UNION SYMBOLWORKERSSetting the SceneFocusOne factor supporting indus-trialization in the late nineteenthcentury was the abundant labor sup-ply. For workers, poor pay and working conditions ledto a renewed interest in labor unions. Efforts by unions such as theKnights of Labor to improve conditions, however, were only modestlysuccessful. The union movement was also influenced by the influx ofmillions of immigrants. These new arrivals crowded into America's citiesand brought with them the cultural heritage of their old world.Journal NotesConcepts to UnderstandWhat were some of theHow unity among workers led to the growth of unionsmajor obstacles facingimmigrants coming to theHow conflict between workers and employees resulted in unrestUnited States in the late1800s?

This was the indus-trial union, in which all classes of workers ina single industry are joined together. Amongthose who saw the advantages of an indus-trial union was Eugene V. Debs, an officer ofthe Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen,one of several railway unions. He felt thatthe separation of railway workers into dif-ferent unions weakened their power. Con-ductors and engineers, the "aristocracy oflabor," looked down on less skilled andlower paid workers, and the unskilled hadno organization at all.

When immi-grants came to the United States, fleeing theirwar-torn countries in the hopes of findingwealth and opportunity, Congress took quickaction. In 1921 Harding signed the Emer-gency Quota Act, which cut the number ofpeople admitted to the United States.According to this act, only 3 percent of thetotal number of people in any national groupalready living in the United States in 1910would be admitted during a single year.Three years later the National Origins Actmade restriction a permanent policy. This1924 law temporarily reduced the quota stillfurther. It also provided that after 1927 a totalof only 150,000 immigrants would be admit-ted to the United States per year, their nation-alities apportioned on the basis of the 1920census.
