How To Deal with America's ProblemsAmericans were confident that by hard work and careful planning, peoplecould solve society's problems. Other Americans strongly believed that tryingto improve society would only make things worse.William Graham Sumner was a professor at Yale University. As you willread in the first section below, Sumner believed that society's problems weretoo difficult for people to be able to solve. He was especially against new lawsto try to improve society.President Theodore Roosevelt, on the other hand, had a strong belief thatmany things that were wrong in American society could be reformed. In thesecond selection below, he explains that he is certain that people can worktogether to change their lives.A PRESIDENT'S VIEWWe recognizethe evils [prob-lems] of today.
