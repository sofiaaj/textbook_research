It is the dramatic story of how many people came together and developed a nation and a way of life. The story begins long before Kuropean explorers came upon the land that became known as the Americas. It began during prehistoric times—before people kept written records. Playing leading roles were Ice Age hunters from .Asia and their descendants, the Native Americans, who established rich traditions on two continents. Not everyone agrees how people first came to the Americas. Some Native Americans believe that their people have always lived on the American continents. Many scientists, however, theorize that the first people to arrive in North America were nomads, groups of people constantly on the move in search of food. It is thought that these nomads journeyed by foot from Asia to North America many thousands of years ago during the last Ice Age. The routes of their probable migrations are shown on the map below. The Ice Ages were periods when the Earth's temperature dropped so steeply that giant sheets of ice, called glaciers, covered much of the Earth. With so much of Earth's water trapped in the form of ice, the water level of the oceans fell, and some of the higher areas of the ocean floor appeared. One such place may have been the Bering Strait, a 50-mile stretch of ocean that today separates Asia from North America. During the last Ice Age, a bridge of land connected the two continents. Bighorn sheep, bison, bears, and moose moved back and forth across the land bridge. Some scientists believe that the nomads migrated, or ▲ Geography The earliest Americans may have walked across this land bridge in search of food. Interpreting the Map What present-day continents does the land bridge connect? 4+ Unit 1 moved, across the land bridge from Siberia to North America to hunt these animals. About 10,000 years ago, the Ice Age ended, and Earth began to warm. Glaciers melted and the water level of the oceans rose once again, covering the land bridge between Asia and North America. No longer could humans or animals w alk from one continent to another. But by that time, hundreds of thousands of people lived in North and South America. According to some scientists, how was it possible for nomads to reach North America during the Ice Age? I'he descendants of those early migrants are called Native Americans because they are believed to be the first to be native to, or born on, the American continents. As the climate changed, groups of these people slowly moved south and modified their way of life to suit the new environments they encountered. From hunting animals and gathering plants, some Native Americans gradually turned to agriculture, the practice of growing crops. Some historians believe that women were most likely the first to plant because, as seed gatherers, they probably noticed that seeds began to sprout after lying in the ground. Planting and harvesting meant that by 8000 b.c;., people no longer had to be constantly on the move in search of food. Instead, they could settle in one place. Small groups began to build shelters and form permanent villages. This led to a division of labor. While some people produced food for the village, others were able to become specialized at tasks such as pottery making, weaving, teaching, and healing. Native Americans were engaged in the agricultural revolution that was taking place in Europe, Asia, and Africa at about die same time. The land and climate where cadi group settled influenced the kinds of houses they built, the foods they ate, and the ways they traveled. The chart on page 6 shows how Native American groups in different regions of North America developed ways of life to adjust to their environments. Two of the largest groups of Native Americans living in North An eric a were located in the Eastern Woodlands and die Soudiwest. Their cultures are evidence of how people adapt to their surroundings to create different ways of life.

Eastern Woodlanders hunted and trapped animals, gathered wild plants for food, and fished in the rivers and streams. They were also successful farmers, often growing a surplus of food, or more than they needed. Surplus food was traded with neighboring groups for other goods. With food so plentiful, populations grew' One Huron town that was uncovered in the Great Lakes region had a population of about 5,000 people. It was larger than the average European town of the 1500s. The Eastern Woodlands was inhabited by two major groups. The largest group was the Algonquin (al-gan'-kwin), which included at least 50 distinct cultures. They lived in small bands, hunting and gathering as well as farming. Several of these peoples, including the Ojibwas (also known as the Chippewas), w'ould become the first fur traders. The most powerful people of the Eastern Woodlands were the Iroquois. They lived in the area of present-day New' York State. They were expert farmers, growing as many as 15 varieties of maize (or corn) and more than 60 different kinds of beans. Like some of the Algonquins, the Iroquois lived in permanent villages. They built long, rectangular-shaped houses from wooden poles made from saplings and tree bark. These longhouses were sometimes about Chapter 1 ♦ 5 group provided dormitories that were supervised by older women. The company also provided education, religious instruction, and entertainment. Working conditions, quite good at first, soon declined. Beginning in die 1830s, wages went down and the working day grew longer. The workers' day began at 5 A.M. and did not end until 7:30 p.M. Many factories employed young children. In 1843, a weaver named Sarah Bagiev and 11 other mill workers in Lowell founded the Female Libor Reform Association. Though the group worked to fight against wage cuts and increased work loads, they never could persuade lawmakers to limit these practices. Conditions in the Lowell textile industry mirrored changing conditions in American industries. A main reason for die worsening conditions in the factories was increased competition. As the factory system grew, the products of new factories competed with established factories. Competition meant low er prices, which forced factory owners to cut their operating costs. A second reason for the worsening of factory conditions was the arrival of waves of immigrants in the United States. Recognizing that immigrants would accept lower pay, the owners hired them and fired higher-paid workers. Mass Production The United States swiftly became a world leader in manufacturing. A German visitor to the United States during the 1820s, noticed that. Everything new is quickly introduced here. There is no clinging to old ways. ! One new technique was the use of interchangeable parts—-parts that w ere identical and that could be used in place of each other to assemble a product. A young Connecticut inventor named Eli Whitney realized that it' the parts of a musket or gun w ere made by machine, individual parts could be identical. Then the parts could be used in any musket the factory made. Until then, if a part broke, a ncwr one had to be made for the particular gun. Whitney's method made it cheaper and easier to manufacture and repair muskets. The use of interchangeable parts spread slowly to other industries. Factories began to produce clocks, knives, locks, and other items with interchangeable parts. Interchangeable parts led to mass production. Mass production is the making of many items in a short period of time. As the system spread to other industries, it came to be known as the "American system of manufacturing." How did the Industrial Revolution change the way goods were produced? During the first half of the 1800s, large numbers of Americans were heading for the western frontier. In those days, the West was the land between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River. Americans from every state along the Atlantic seaboard crossed the Appalachian Mountains and tanned out in all directions toward the Mississippi River. Between 1810 and 1816, Ohio's white population almost doubled and Indiana's almost tripled. On the other hand, most of the original 13 states lost population during that same period. Although some of the westward bound pioneers were immigrants, most were Americans moving to another part of the country. As the territories filled with people, they became eligible to apply for statehood. Between 1812 and 1819, five states—Louisiana, Mississippi, Illinois, Indiana, and Alabama—joined the union. Cheap land was particularly appealing to many pioneers. They were excited by tales of rich, fertile soil in the western regions. Land was becoming more expensive in the East, and opportunities seemed to be lessening. Better Transportation In the early days in the United States, getting from one place to another had been very difficult. Roads were terrible—where rhev even existed. Often they were little more than trails that were too narrow for ev en a single wagon. While rivers and coastal w ater- ways moved traffic more efficiently, they often did not lead where people wanted to go. After 1800, improved transportation helped people move westward. Later, new means of transportation also helped them get their goods to market in die East. Most of the earliest roads were built by private companies that charged tolls. These new turnpikes were named after the pikes, or spiked poles, that were used at toll roads. The pikes were turned aside to let travelers pass after they had paid their tolls. Turnpikes 110 ♦ Unit 2 but stayed in California. They took different kinds of jobs in the mining region or in the growing cities. Their efforts helped build a prosperous community in a region that had much to offer. These new Californians firmly established the United States on the Pacific coast. Opportunity and Prejudice in the Gold Fields Most of those who came to California during the gold rush were men. In 1850 fewer than 2 percent of the people in the gold mining areas were women. Most women w ho went to the gold fields had come overland to California with their husbands. Those who came to California alone usually stayed and worked in the large cities. Single women who did make it to the mining region found opportunities to make money cooking or washing clothes. African Americans also found opportunity in the gold fields. Among the forty-niners were hundreds of free African Americans. Some enslaved African Americans came with their owners. However, white miners objected to slaves working in the gold fields. They refused to compete with slave labor. In 1849 a group of Texans tried to put their enslaved people to work panning for gold. In response, the w hite miners got together and ordered them to leas e. But by 1852 there were 2,000 African Americans in California, many working in the area's mines. Immigrants from China also found opportunity in the gold fields. The gold rush drew 20,000 Chinese immigrants to California within three years. After the gold rush ended, many stayed in California and worked in a wide variety of jobs and businesses. Chinese immigrants faced widespread discrimination in the gold fields, as did other foreign immigrants. In 1850 the California legislature passed a Foreign Miners' Tax requiring miners who were nor citizens to pay a high fee to dig for gold. The law, written to restrict Chinese miners, also counted Californios as foreigners, even though they were U.S. citizens. Californios, Mexicans, and other Hispanics were expelled from the mines. If they resisted, violence was often used against them. How did the gold rush affect the population of California? The gold rush attracted thousands of Chinese immigrants. In spite of discrimination, many became successful, and their descendants remain in the United States today. ▼ Chapter 7 ♦ 139 Chapter 8 Immigration and Reform 1820-1860 Section 1 A More Diverse Nation The United States changed as its cities rapidly expanded and immigrants arrived in great numbers.

Chapter 8 ♦ 145 Section 1 A More Diverse Nation Objectives To explain why people flocked to American cities after the 1820s To analyze the reasons for the formation of unions • To identify the causes for a wave of immigration from western Europe Vocabulary labor union rural urban mechanical reaper thresher tenement strike nativism Americans not only moved westward between 1820 and 1860, but they also moved into the growing cities of the United States. Though people found new opportunities there, they faced new problems, too. Often they had to live and work in overcrow ded conditions. Factory workers in the cities worked long hours. To improve their lives, workers tried to band together to form the first American labor unions. A labor union is a group of workers who organize to protect their rights and improve working conditions. In the early 1800s, the United States was almost completely a rural nation, where most Americans lived on farms in the country. Only 6 percent of the five million Americans lived in towns with a population of 2,500 or more. There were just six cities w ith populations of more than 10,000 people. Only Philadelphia and New York each had more than 50,000 people. In the 1820s, American cities began to expand. Anne Royall, a self educated woman who traveled widely, portrayed the excitement and energy of New York City in 1826. Touring the waterfront, she wrote. The warehouses, docks, shipyards [contain] a flood of human beings. Here the sound of axes, saws, and hammers from a thousand hands; there the ringing of the blacksmith's anvil . . . the whole city surrounded by masts; the Hudson, East rivers, and the bay covered with vessels. In short, imagine upwards of a hundred thousand people, all engaged in business. Add to these more than a thousand strangers which swarm in the streets. Such is Ncwr York. By 1850, the United States was being transformed into an urban nation, or a place with many cities. In 1850 more than 60 cities each had more than 10,000 people. Seven had populations of more than 100,000 people. New York City, the largest city, had more than 500,000 people. Beyond the Appalachians, new cities, such as Chicago and St. Louis, were growing quickly. Changes on the Farm Between 1820 and 1850, a number of inventions changed the way Americans farmed. One invention w as Cyrus McCormick's mechanical reaper, a machine for harvesting grain. Before the mechanical reaper, farmers had to cut and gather wheat using hand tools. With McCormick's reaper, farmers could harvest as much in a day as they could in two weeks using a hand-held cutting implement, the sickle. Other inventions also helped farmers work faster and produce more. A mechanical hay mower made it possible for one farmer to do the work of eight farmers working by hand. The mechanical thresher speeded the work of separating the valuable kernels of the wheat plant from the husks. John Deere's new steel plows helped farmers turn over the soil of the Great Plains. Farmers no longer produced food just for themselves and their families, as they had in 1800, There was now' a surplus of crops to sell. New methods of transportation also changed farming. By 1850, American farmers were sending their products by train to customers in distant markets. They also were buying machines, tools, nails, and other products from factories in the cities. As machines took over jobs once done by hand, there was a surplus of labor on the farms. People who were no longer needed to w ork on farms w ere forced to go to the cities to find work. 146 ♦ Unit 2 Life and Work in the Cities Iliere were many jobs in the cities for people leasing the farms. Businesses and industries needed salespeople, clerks, laborers, skilled craftworkcrs, and factory workers. However, the rapid growth of cities created many problems. Services did not keep up with the population growth. Sewer systems were inadequate. Human waste and garbage often polluted drinking water. The huge numbers of animals living in the cities made conditions even more unhealthful. Overcrowding in poorer neighborhoods bred disease. Smallpox, diphtheria, and yellow fever spread quickly. Slums such as New York's Five Points neighborhood appeared during the 1820s. Immigrants from Ireland and Germany, native-born laborers, free African Americans, and working people without job skills crowded into these neighborhoods. They lived in tenements, apartment buildings that often did not meet high standards for sanitation and safety. Sometimes a dozen or more people lived in a single room. Fire was a constant danger to tenement dwellers. As difficult as city life was, many cities were places of technological change, as well as examples of social and political reform. Boston introduced gas street lights in 1822. New York started a public transportation system in 1828. Several cities set up police forces for public safety. New York started its police force in 1844. Boston and Philadelphia followed. Why did American cities experience rapid growth in the first half of the 1800s? During the first half of the 1800s, many American factory' workers endured poor working conditions and low wages. So, too, did laborers who dug canals or built railways. Artisans, who were skilled workers in crafts, enjoyed much better conditions. Shoemakers, carpenters, tailors, cabinet makers, printers, and house builders were the first American workers to form labor unions. The first artisans to organize were shoemakers in Philadelphia in the 1790s. Craftworkcrs in other trades and in odier cities quickly did die same. Membership in each new union was limited to skilled workers in a particular craft. The rapid growth of cities often created overcrowding in poorer neighborhoods. Many immigrants were forced to live in cramped and dirty neighborhoods, such as the one pictured here. ▼ !"". Ef- '*• si -L7 : " 1% y'.t - ^ -ta J gf ' § Chapter 8 ♦ 147 ▲ In 1860 in Massachusetts, 800 women shoemakers went on strike to demand better working conditions. The first unions tried to get their members and employers to agree to certain wages or conditions. Some workers went on strike, or work stoppage to protest an act or condition, when employers refused. The early labor unions did not survive tor long after courts began ruling that these strikes, which interfered with trade, were illegal. Until the mid 1800s, the effectiveness of unions increased during times of economic prosperity and decreased during economic downturns. When jobs w ere scarce, workers did not make demands. During bad times, employers found people willing to work even under undesirable conditions. For example, after an economic downturn in 1819, almost evert' existing union closed. Unions Revive When better economic times returned in the mid-1820s, artisans from many trades organized again. As before, they protested against competition from unskilled workers. The artisans were especially upset over the new competition from factories. Often, women and children worked in these factories for low wages and under poor conditions. The goods they produced could be sold more cheaply than goods made by skilled craftworkers. By the mid-1830s, there were more than 200 active labor unions with more than 300,000 members. More than 160 strikes took place between 1833 and 1837. Yet most of these strikes were unsuccessful. Employers hired nonunion workers at lower wages to take the place of the strikers The National Trades' Union The labor union movement slowly grew in spite of the unions' inability to change working conditions. In 1834, delegates from a number of craft unions in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and other cities met in New York to form the National Trades' Union. During 1833 and 1836, shoemakers and carpenters formed national unions. However, in 1837 hard economic times returned. Workers were willing to accept almost any wage in order to survive. Neither the National Trades' Union nor the national craft unions survived the difficult years that followed. When prosperity returned in the 1840s, workers once again began to organize unions. They won a small victory with an 1842 court decision in Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that unions had a legal right to exist. The court said it was not "criminal for men to agree together to exercise their... rights ... to serve their own interests." Unskilled workers had less success in organizing. Young women in factories frequently were paid S3 for working six 12-hour days per week. Strikes were unusual because the women knew that immigrants were cheap replacements. Immigrants, eager to get work, would often take very low -paying jobs. Women's unions formed, but they did not last. In 1834, factory owners in Lowell, Massachusetts, cut women's wages by 15 percent. One thousand women went out on strike, but the owners threatened to hire other workers, and the strike collapsed.

From 1830 to 1840, more than half a million immigrants arrived in the United States. Porn'-four percent came from Ireland, 15 percent came from Great Britain, and the rest came from other European countries. A million and a half immigrants came between 1840 and 1850. Forty-nine percent of them were from Ireland. To reach the United States, the immigrants endured terrible hardships. They were packed into crowded, poorly managed, and poorly ventilated vessels. Hunger and disease were common. Many did not survive the voyage or were hospitalized when they arrived. Immigration from Ireland large numbers of Irish immigrants came to the United States after disease wiped out the entire potato crop in 1845. Potatoes were the staple diet in Ireland, and the next several years brought terrible famine and widespread starvation. More than one million people died. Though most of the new Irish immigrants had been farmers, few had the money to buy land in the United States. Instead, most settled in the cities of the Northeast, where low-paying jobs were available. By the 1850s the Irish made up half the population of New York and Boston. They also found homes in other growing cities, such as Albany, Baltimore, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and New' Orleans. Because they had few job skills, most Irish immigrant men took jobs as laborers or factory workers. They helped build railroads, worked on the docks, and did other hard manual work. Irish women often worked as servants in private homes or in factories. The growing industrialization of the United States was creating many jobs for these and other immigrants. German Immigration Unlike the Irish, many Germans immigrated to the United States because of political conditions in their homeland. In 1848 a revolution swept Germany. The goal of the revolutionaries was to establish democracy, but the revolution failed. Many supporters of democracy were forced to flee. Between 1848 and 1860, one million Germans came to the United States. ▲ The challenges immigrants faced in adapting to a new land were often expressed in songs. Pictured above is the cover of one such song. Many of the German immigrants found little difficulty in settling in the United States. Most had some money, and many were skilled in crafts or farming. Some immigrants moved to farms in the Midwest. Others settled in midwestern cities and towns and opened businesses. Soon there were large communities of German immigrants in St. Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee, and Cincinnati. A German immigrant who arrived in Chicago in the 1850s described life in his new home: The houses in which wc lived in those days in Chicago were modest one- or two-story frame dwellings. .,. Business houses were at no great distance from the homes and the men were generally to be found w ith their families after business hours. The women occupied themselves with needlework, household dudes, and reading. The children were reared to honor and obey their parents. A small minority' of the immigrants from Germany were Jewish.

By the time of the Civil War, there were about 150 communities with large Jewish populations across the United States. The graph above provides information on immigration from Great Britain, Ireland, and Germany between 1820 and 1860. Reaction to Immigration The arrival of many foreign-born people caused problems among native-born Americans. Many distrusted the customs, dress, and language of the immigrants. Also, native-born workers complained that immigrants were willing to work for low' wages. Competition for jobs tended to drive wages down. Furthermore, when native-born workers went out on strike, owners often hired immigrants to replace them. In the 1840s a wave of resentment against immigration swept the United States. This reaction against foreign-born people is called nativism because it came from native-born Americans. By the 1850s, hostility to immigrants was so strong that the nativists firmed a new political part)', the American Part)'. Members promised to say nothing about their involvement. When asked about their party, they were told to say, "I know nothing." As a resuit, the party- became known as the Know-Nothings. The Know Nothings were anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant. They claimed that Catholics who won government posts would be under the control of the Pope in Italy. They also feared that the immigrants would threaten their jobs. The party's message was popular, and the part)' did w^cll in elections during the mid-1850s. Some of its members were elected to Congress. However, the Know-Nothing movement faded in the late 1850s, when members became divided over the issue of slavery. Yet nativism did not disappear with the end of the Know-Nothings. Over the years it continued to rise and fall. In periods of high immigration, nativist feelings tended to rise again, only to recede when the gates were closed to immigrants.

Causes are conditions that lead to an event; effects are the outcome of the event. Since history is a series of events, the effect of one event may be the cause of another. For example, the desire for new trade routes was a cause of early explorations. These explorations caused other events to occur. Among the effects of these explorations were encounters that took place between different cultures. These encounters, in turn, led to great changes for many people. Here'.* How Follow these steps to recognize the relationship between causes and effects: 1. Study the conditions that led to the event. These are the causes. 2. Study what happened as a result of the causes. These are the effects. 3. Look for the connections between one event and another. 4. Look tor key words. Since, due to, and because often indicate causes. So, therefore, and as a result often indicate effects.

Their entry into the workforce in both the North and the South had effects that lasted long after the war. On the Battlefield Hundreds of women became battlefield nurses. Dorothea Dix, well known for her work helping the mentally disabled, volunteered to serve as a nurse. The Secretary of War appointed her to take charge of all Union nurses. Clara Barton and abolitionist activist Sojourner Truth also served as nurses for the Union. Clara Barton believed that the war created employment opportunities that normally would have taken another 50 years for women to obtain. Women played other important medical roles as well. Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell trained nurses for work in Union hospitals. Sally Ixiuisa Tompkins founded small clinics and hospitals in the South. She was commissioned as a captain in the Confederate army so that her facilities could quality' as military hospitals. A few women served as spies. Belle Boyd went behind Union lines to get information for the Confederacy. Pauline Cushman spied for the North, pretending to be an actress while behind enemy lines in die South. Elizabeth Bowser and Harriet Tubman supplied information to the Union from behind enemy lines. How did women contribute lo the Union and the Confederate Civil War efforts? Approximately 10,000 Hispanics fought for the North and the South during the Civil War. In addition to Hispanic regiments led by Hispanic officers, such as the all-Californio Union regiment led by- Salvador Vallejo, many Hispanics fought side by side in army or volunteer units with soldiers who were not of Latin descent. David Glasgow Earragut was one of the most famous Hispanic heroes of die war. Commander of the Union ships charged with blockading Confederate ports, he captured New Orleans in 1862. Two years later, in attempting to launch an assault on the heavily protected harbor in Mobile, Alabama, he voiced his famous cry, "Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!" Earragut avoided the torpedoes, entered the harbor, and captured die town. In 1866, he became the first four star admiral in the nation. Other Hispanics did equally daring tasks during the war. Manuel Chaves, known as El Leottcito ("the Little Lion"), led 490 New Mexicans in a spectacular attack on a Confederate spy train. Cuban-born Lieutenant Colonel Federico Fernandez Cavada did airborne reconnaissance, or exploratory surveys, from hot-air balloons for the Union. Cuban-born Loreta laneta Vclaquez was both a soldier and a spy for the Confederacy. Disguised as a man, she fought at Bull Run in 1861.

Often the best "buys" were not men at all, but women and children who were paid far cheaper wages than the men. Between 1880 and 1900, the number of working women grew from 2.6 million to 8.6 million. By 1910 the number of child workers between the ages of 10 and 15 swelled to nearly two million. The work that women did in the late 1800s varied widely. In large part it depended upon a woman's education and social class. When the typewriter and telephone came into wide use, middle-class women with high school educations moved into clerical jobs once held by men. They also took jobs in the growing numbers of department stores. Many working women contributed to the incomes of their families. With men earning low' wages, families found it difficult to get by on one income. Since men dominated jobs in heavy industries, such as mining and steel, women took jobs in the textile, food processing, and garment industries. Here they endured the same long hours and poor working conditions as men, but often at far lower wages. Children received even lower pay. The use of machines had reduced the physical effort of many jobs. Employers gave these jobs to children for j fraction of the rate paid to adults. There were few protections for the children. Some states had child labor laws that set minimum ages and maximum working hours for children. However, these laws did not apply to industries that did business in more than one state. Most states did not rigorously enforce the laws. Mary Harris Jones, an early union organizer, described the working conditions endured by children in some mills: Little girls and boy's, barefooted, walked up and dow n between endless rows of spindles. They reached their little hands into the machinery to repair snapped threads. They crawled under the machinery to oil it. . . . Tiny babies of six years old with faces of sixty' did an eight hour shift for ten cents a day. In 1910 almost two million children worked long hours in factories, mines, and fields. Six- and seven-year- olds often started work in factories at two o'clock in the morning. ► 264 ♦ Unit 4 Section 1 m Immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe Objectives • To describe the reasons for European immigration at the end of die 1800s • To discuss the problems that immigrants laced, particularly in cities • To explain the steps taken by immigrants to ease the difficulties of adjusting tt> American life Vocabulary scapegoat pogrom steerage The story of the United States is the story of immigrants: why they came to this country and how they have shaped its history through the centuries. Time and again, leaders have reminded Americans of their immigrant past. "We arc, one and all, immigrants or sons and daughters of immigrants," said President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s. The newcomers who arrived in the United States in the late 1800s and early 1900s came mostly from countries in southern and eastern Europe—countries such as Italy, Greece, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Himgary. Americans called the wave of people arriving at this time the "new immigrants" because they came from different places than had earlier immigrants. Most of the "old immigrants," who had arrived in the 1700s and early 1800s, had come from countries in western and northern Europe, such as England, Scotland, Ireland, and Germany. Throughout the 1700s and early 1800s, hopes of a better life drew millions of immigrants across the Atlantic, as shown on the map on page 273. Immigration from northern and western Europe peaked in the 1840s and 1850s. These immigrants helped settle areas of the American frontier, energize the growing number of cities, and begin building the transportation networks that would link the nation. By 1885 the country was begining to welcome growing numbers of immigrants from countries in southern and eastern Europe. While immigrants continued to come from northern and western Europe, by the early 1900s they were outnumbered by these "new immigrants," as shown on the pic charts below. For almost 30 years, Italians, Slavs, Greeks, Russians, Armenians, and others immigrated to the United States in large numbers. By 1920 the foreign-born population of the United States totaled more than 14 million people, out of a total U.S. population of 106 million. The new immigrants included people of mam- different religious traditions. They introduced their religious faiths, including Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Judaism to parts of the United States. The levels of education of the new immigrants varied, from schoolmasters to those who were unable to read and write. Their religion, cus toms, and language made them seem strange to many Americans. ▲ History These pie charts show trends in immigration from 1861 to 1880 and from 1901 to 1920.

Interpreting the Map During which years did many people immigrate to the United States from Italy? Leaving European Homelands As with earlier immigrants, including the American colonists of the seventeenth century, people left their European homelands for a variety of reasons. Many of the new immigrants left because of overpopulation and lack of economic opportunity. Personal freedom and abundant land attracted many to America. Others left their homelands because of religious persecution. This was especially true of Jews who had lived in Russia and eastern Europe. In Russia, the government used Jews as scapegoats—people unfairly blamed for a bad situation or a problem. Scapegoating sometimes occurs when a country experiences economic and political unrest. Jews became the object of prejudice, with Russian law forcing them to live in separate towns in a region called the Pale of Settlement. Here, Jews often became targets for pogroms, or organized attacks on unarmed people. The threat of violence and death led nearly one third of all Jews in Russia and eastern Europe to leave the region. Most looked to one place for freedom—the United States. Going to America Advertisements by U.S. railroad and steamship companies beginning in the mid- 1800s, encouraged people to come to the United States. These advertisements told of cheap land on the prairies and numerous jobs in growing U.S. industries. To encourage passengers, steamship lines lowered their prices. Those willing to travel in steerage, a large open area beneath the ship's deck, could purchase a ticket for $15—about one month's wage for some passengers. Thousands took advantage of these o tiers. Immigrants who packed into sreerage spent the entire two- or three-week journey tossed about in an overcrowded, unsanitary area. In recalling the trip, one woman wTote, The ship heaved and turned. People threw up, dishes fell, women screamed ... but I didn't care what happened. I was going to America! Immigrants entered the United States through several ports. However, about seven out of every ten arrivals from Europe sailed into New York Harbor. Those who arrived after 1892 first landed at Hllis Island, near Liberty Island, the location of the Statue of liberty. They could see the statue, erected in 1886, as a symbol of hope and refuge. Nearly two thirds of all nineteenth-century immigrants wxrc males between the ages of 15 and 39. Chapter 14 *273 A large percentage of them could not read and write in their native languages. Among those who reported occupations, almost one half listed a skilled trade, while the remainder were farmers. Because many immigrants had little money for further transportation, they often settled near the ports of entry, in cities such as New York Cits', New York, or Newark, New Jersey. A large number, however, traveled inland to live at railroad and industrial centers, such as Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, or Chicago. Of those immigrants who came to the United States seeking free land and rich soil, most never realized tlus dream. By the late 1800s, the era of frontier settlement was drawing to a close. The farmland promised by many railroad and steamship lines had already been carved up into large farms and ranches. Would-be farmers found that they did not have the money to buy land, and instead settled in midwestem cities to pursue other work. ?What contributed to the rise in immigration from southern and eastern Europe in the late 1800s? The wave of new arrivals had an enormous impact on the cities where they settled, causing the population to soar. For example, in 1890, New York City had twice as many Irish residents as Dublin, Ireland; as many Germans as Hamburg, Germany; half as many Italians as Naples, Italy; and two-and-a- half times as many Jews as Warsaw, Poland. That same year, four out of five children in the New York City area had either been born in another country or were the children of immigrants. Because cities were populated by immigrants from so many different backgrounds, neighborhoods reflecting each group's culture and origin emerged. People who shared the same customs, language, and religion felt they belonged to the same community. Although these neighborhoods, sometimes called ghettos, often had overcrowded tenements, they helped immigrants adjust to the United States. Adjusting to a New Land During the first difficult months of adjustment to life in rite United States, many immigrants struggled to learn the English language. Peddlers, landlords, and employment agencies charged them inflated prices for their goods. Other immigrants were targets of insults hurled by native-born Americans. Such practices caused one immigrant to write these words of caution to a friend back home: When you land in America, you will find many who will offer their services, but beware of them because there are so many rascals who make it their business to cheat the immigrants. Difficult living conditions also created stress for immigrants. Many immigrants lived in almost win- dowlcss apartments called railroad flats, so named because the rooms connected in a straight line, like the cars of a railroad train. Many of the flats lacked plumbing and heating. Some immigrant families lived in tenement houses with poor sanitation and little space for each family member. The jobs offered to most immigrants, in factoncs, warehouses, and ship and train yards, required tew skills but a great deal of physical labor. It was often the new immigrants who paved streets, dug sewers and subways, and built bridges in eastern cities. For the first time in their lives, many of the immigrants worked according to the dock instead of the rising and setting of the sun, as was the custom throughout rural Europe.

In some ethnic neighborhoods, immigrants pooled their money to form self-help associations. The New York Hebrew Free Loan Society, for example, founded in 1892, gave loans of S10 to S200 to Jewish immigrants who wanted to set up small businesses in New York City, hi Bridgeport, Connecticut, Italian immigrant Pasquale Cruci helped found a medical and life insurance fund for fellow Italian immigrants in the area. "I felt that the Italian people of this city should have some security from death and accidents," explained Cruci. Gradually through their children's schools and then through newspapers, marketplaces, and work environments, immigrants were introduced to American ways of doing things, and also to the English language. Learning English helped newcomers blend into American culture, making it easier for them to find jobs, raise their families, and socialize with other Americans. In time, immigrants learned to cook .American foods, sew American fashions, and sing American tunes. At the same time they also contributed their native foods, fashions, and songs to the culture of the United States. How did living together in neighborhoods help immigrants to adjust to American life? ◄ These immigrants waited in line on Ellis Island for a ferry to take them to New York City.

Generalizing allows you to connect information you have learned in a broader, less specific way. You add up facts and details and draw some general ideas from that particular information. A generalization is valid, or sound, when it is broad enough to apply to a number of different examples of a group or topic. A sound generalization is also logical and based on facts. For example, based on what you have read in this chapter, you may generalize that many nineteenth-century immigrants suffered great hardships. Here'j Hon* Follow these steps to make a valid generalization: 1. Focus on a topic and compile a list of relevant facts about the topic. 2. Study the facts and find a single feature that is true of all examples of the topic. If there is no relationship among the facts, then you should not try to make a generalization. 3. Make a general statement based on the facts. Accurate generalizations often have one of the following clue words: many, most, often, usually, some, far, and sometimes. Faulty generalizations may include the words all, none, always, never, or every. Here U Why Without generalizations, history would not have much meaning. Isolated facts are not memorable or even important until they can be unified to show rcla tionships and patterns. This skill can help you clarify your understanding of material you have read. 276 ♦ Unit 4 Practice the Skill Try making a valid generalization about why immigrants came to the United States during the mid to late 1800s.

Others resented the newcomers because they competed for jobs. Some opponents of immigration demanded that the government eliminate immigration into the United States or at least lessen the number of people allowed to enter. Beginning in the 1880s, the government essentially excluded Chinese immigrants and severely limited the number of European and Japanese immigrants. When the United States acquired California from Mexico in 1848, it welcomed Asian immigrants, especially those from China. Some policy makers saw Chinese immigrants as a key to the region's future. "No people in all of the East are so w ell adapted for clearing wild lands and raising every species of agricultural product as the Chinese," wrote one government official. In China, labor recruiters, or people paid to bring laborers to America, painted a glowing picture of the United States. One brochure circulated in Chinese i ports declared. Americans arc very rich people. They want the [Chinese] to come. ... You will have great pay, large houses and food and clothing of the finest description.... It is a nice country.... Money is plentiful in America. Immigrants from China News of the 1848 California gold rush reinforced the excitement generated by labor recruiters in China. Until 1860 about tw o thirds of the Chinese population in the United States labored in the gold mines. The majority of these workers had paid their own fares to die United States. They planned to work for a short while, then return to China with the money they earned)' Many Chinese eventually settled in western cities. When mining began to decline in the 1860s, some helped build the first transcontinental railroad. When it was completed in 1869, thousands of these workers moved to San Frandsco to find work. By 1870 the city' had a Chinese population of more than 12,000, making it the center of Chinese culture in the United States. Wherever Chinese people settled in large numbers, they built neighborhoods known as Chinatowns. As with other immigrant groups, Chinese laborers, largely men, were an important part of the work force. By the 1870s they made up nearly 75 percent of San Erancisco's woolen-mill workers and almost 90 percent of the city's cigarmakers. Others took agricultural jobs in the San Joaquin and Sacramento river deltas. Draining swamps and building irrigation ditches, they were among the laborers who turned the area into one of the most productive farming regions in the nation. Immigrants from Japan The Japanese immigration boom began in the 1880s when the Japanese government allowed laborers to travel to Hawaii, then an independent nation. There, w orkers on American-owned sugar plantations could earn six times more than they could in Japan. Wlicn the United States acquired Hawaii in 1898, some Japanese migrants, or workers who travel from job to job, headed to the mainland. Between 1885 and 1924, about 300,000 Japanese immigrants came directly to the continental United States. Many settled in California, w here they took jobs in agriculture, in railroad construction, or in canneries, which are factories that produce canned Chapter 14 +277 A By 1870, more than 100.000 Chinese had emigrated to the United States. Many were men who hoped to return eventually to their families in China. goods. Their goal was to earn enough money to fulfill their dreams of buying farmland. By 1920 the value of Japanese American farm products was more than S67 million—about 10 percent of rhe value of all California crops. Japanese American farmers grew nearly 70 percent of California's strawberries, The success of Japanese immigrants w as due in part to the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. Farming became more profitable in California when fruits and vegetables could be shipped to markets in the East .ill year long. The success of Japanese immigrants triggered jeal- ous)' among some native-born Americans. Newspapers used the term "Yellow Peril" to describe the Japanese. This racial insult implied that somehow Japanese immigrants threatened the United States. The Rise of Nativism Nativism was not a new reaction. It had gained force at the height of the German and Irish immigra tions of the 1840s and 1850s. It now reemerged as a reaction against the immigrants arriving at the close of the 1800s. Some Protestants, for example, feared the growing number of Catholics and Jews arriving from southern and eastern Europe. These religions were unfamiliar, and anxiety of the unknown produced fear. While many supported the admission of immigrants Other Asian Groups The first Korean immigrants came to Hawaii and then to the California coast of the United States between 1903 and 1905. Small in number, Koreans generally were absorbed into other Asian communities. Initially, they worked at the same kinds of low-paying jobs as Chinese and Japanese immigrants. Filipino immigrants began coming to the United States as early as 1899. Because the Philippines were under American rule after that year, Filipinos were able to bypass the usual immigration procedures. Escaping from the poverty of their homeland, many Filipinos migrated throughout the West, following the crops. Others worked in canneries in Washington and Alaska. Why did large numbers of Chinese and Japanese immigrants come to the United States? The hostility directed toward Japanese immigrants by some Americans reflected a widespread opposition to immigration in general. This opposition had been growing steadily since rhe mid- 1800s Many native-born Americans liked to think of the United States as a huge "melting pot" where different immigrant cultures would blend together and into American society. However, the reality was that many of the newcomers chose to maintain their own cultural identity. The strong presence of ethnic neighborhoods, or those based on a common racial, national, religious, or cultural tradition, triggered anti-immigrant feelings among many native-born Americans. These prejudices grew as competition for jobs increased. The result was renewed nativism, which put the interests of native- born Americans above those of immigrants. 278 ♦ Unit 4 from the European nations that had built the 13 colonies, they opposed admission of immigrants from other parts of the world, including Asia. On the east coast, nativists focused their efforts on curbing immigration from southern and eastern Europe. The Immigration Restriction Ixague, formed in 1894, demanded that immigrants from those regions pass a literacy test, a test of ability to read English, before entering the United States. In 1896, Congress passed such a law, but President Grover Cleveland vetoed it. Anti-Asian Policies On the west coast, prejudice fell heaviest on Asian immigrants, particularly those from China. In addition to speaking a different language and practicing unfamiliar customs, Chinese men made little effort to assimilate to American styles. They wore their hair in long pigtails, called queues, and wore clothes from their home country—wide-brimmed hats and quilted jackets. A depression from 1873 to 1878 increased anti- Chinese sentiment as native-born workers grew concerned that they would lose their jobs to Chinese workers. Violent anti-Chinese riots erupted throughout California. Meanwhile, some .American labor leaders called for a ban on Chinese immigration. In 1882 the U.S. government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The act denied citizenship to those born in China and banned immigration of Chinese laborers for ten years. It was renewed through 1902, when it was made "permanent" until it was repealed in 1943. The Chinese Exclusion Act did not prevent entry to those who had previously lived in rhe United States or who had family already living in the country. In 1910 the government built a detention center on Angel Island in San Francisco Bax'. Here immigrants could be held temporarily until their claims of prior residence or relationship to U.S. citizens could be examined. With most Chinese excluded from entering the country, Japanese immigrants stepped in to take jobs once filled by Chinese laborers. However, they too won tell victim to anti-Asian attitudes. In 1906, efforts were made to exclude Japanese children from public schools in San Francisco. Soon after, the United States negotiated a so-called "Gentlemen's Agreement" with Japan. Under this agreement only the parents, wives, and children of Japanese people already living in the United States were permitted entry. In exchange, the U.S. government convinced officials in San Francisco to drop efforts to exclude Asian children from the city's free public schools. What actions did nativists take to curb immigration to the United States? As the United States limited Asian immigration, increasing numbers of people from Latin America began to emigrate to rhe United States. The greatest number of newcomers were from Mexico, w hich had won its independence from Spain in 1821. Other Latin American immigrants came from die islands of Puerto Rico and Cuba, which gained independence from Spain in 1898. Anti-immigration restrictions passed by Congress in the late 1800s and early 1900s applied mainly to Asians and not to Latin Americans. As a result, the United States experienced the start of a huge influx of largely' Spanish-speaking, Roman Catholic immigrants. Their arrival signaled rhe start of a movement of people that would continue throughout the 1900s. Mexican Immigrants Like other immigrants, Mexicans saw the United States as a land of opportunity. They lived close enough to its borders to hear positive reports from friends and relatives who already lived there. Many states—such as Texas, California, Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico—had large Spanish-speaking populations that had been there for generations before the United States acquired the area in rhe 1840s. In 1902, Congress passed the New lands National Reclamation Act to fund the irrigation of southw cstem lands. This act turned millions of acres of desert into fertile farmland and created new jobs. In 1902 alone, about 3 percent of die population of Mexico entered the United States dirough El Paso, Texas. In 1910, revolution broke out in Mexico. War and economic disorder forced many Mexicans to flee. The United States offered them opportunities for jobs in mining, railroad construction, and especially farming. In orchards and fields throughout the Southwest, Mexican workers picked artichokes, grapefruits, and melons. Between 1910 and 1919, during the years of the Mexican Revolution, approximately 185,000 Mexicans entered the United States. Chapter 14 +279 These children belonged to the Cuban Club in Ybor City, Florida. The town was built by Vincente Ybor, who employed many Cubans in his cigar factory. ► Immigrants from Cuba and Puerto Rico By 1860, Cuba was one of Spain's last colonies in the Americas. Efforts by Cubans to throw off Spanish rule resulted in fighting between Cuba and Spain, beginning in the 1860s. In 1898 the United States entered into the conflict to help free Cuba of Spanish rule in the Spanish American War. After Spain lost the war, Cuba gained its independence. During the late 1800s, many Cubans emigrated to the United States to escape the fighting and discontent in their homeland. They set tied in cigarmaking centers in New York Cits' and near Tampa, Florida. Like Cuba, the island of Puerto Rico was one of Spain's last colonics in the Americas. As a result of the U.S. victory in the Spanish-Amcrican War, the United States gained possession of Puerto Rico in 1898. Soon after, Puerto Ricans began moving to the United States to look for job opportunities. After 1917, however, Puerto Ricans were not immigrants. In 1917, Congress passed the )ones Act, which granted all Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship. Puerto Ricans could move freely to and from the U.S. mainland. Many took advantage of this and moved to New York City, which still has one of the mainland's largest Puerto Rican populations.

Not only did it add a new dimension to women's wardrobes, but it also provided a new sense of independence and mobility for young people. Spectator sports were equally popular, especially boxing and baseball. Of the two, baseball had the wider appeal. By 1903 the United States had two professional leagues—the National League and the American League—and they competed in the first World Series. Baseball had become what historians called a "national pastime." It also grew into a big business. By the late 1800s, most large cities had a team of their own. Public Education The cities also offered opportunities for Americans who wanted to advance their education. In a time when few nations offered public education, the United States was expanding its system of public schools and colleges. By the early 1900s, the United States had made strides toward educating all its youth. Between 1X70 and 1900, the number of public high schools in the nation rose tram 160 to 6,000. During these same years, 31 states passed laws that required children between the ages of 8 and 14 to receive 12 to 16 weeks of education per year. By 1900 almost 75 percent of children between those ages attended public schools. Although few Americans attended universities, the opportunity for higher education began to grow. Between 1880 and 1900, nearly 150 colleges and universities opened. Almost 70 colleges devel oped as a result of the Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862. This act gave large grants of land to states to establish colleges to teach "agriculture and the mechanical arts." Famous land-grant colleges founded as a result of the act include Cornell University and the state university systems of Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, and Illinois. These new and expanded educational opportunities rarely benefited African Americans. Most universities refused to accept their applications. Segregation also kept African American children in run-down schools or out of school entirely. In 1890, nearly tw o thirds of all African Americans could not read and write. Conditions like these caused African American leaders to organize against discrimination, or the unjust treatment of one individual by another based on prejudice. What cultural and educational attractions did cities hold for people? Since the end of Reconstruction, African Americans had faced particular difficulties in the South. Southern states had imposed Jim Crow laws that restricted voting and imposed segregation. African Americans protesting these law's faced the threat of being insulted, beaten, run off their land, or even lynched by organized groups of whites, such as the Ku Klux Man. Violence, poverty, racism, and a lack of jobs and educational opportunities caused about 200,000 African Americans to leave the South and head to the North between 1890 and 1900. This was the beginning of what has been called the Great Migration. After 1917, when the United States entered World War I, the movement of African Americans north accelerated. By 1920, more than 1.4 million African Americans lived in northern cities. Prejudice in the North in the North, African Americans found discrimi nation of a different sort than in the South. It was de facto discrimination, or discrimination in practice instead of by law. Some employers refused to hire African Americans or offered them the least desirable jobs at low pay. Rental agents would not show them apartments or houses in white neighborhoods. As African American migration increased, racial tensions in the North also rose. Riots erupted in several places. The worst riot, in Chicago in 1917, involved 10,000 people. It took state police nearly three days to end the fighting. Organizing for Rights Faced with continuing racial hostility, African Americans took action against discrimination. In 1905 a group of African American leaders came together at a meeting in Niagara Falls, Canada. The site had once been an important station on the Underground Railroad. Under the leadership of W.E.B. Du Bois (d5?>-bois'), a historian, editor, and sociologist, members of the so-called "Niagara Movement" met annually to plan w'ays to resist racism. They demanded full civil rights and an end to racial discrimination. "We do not hesitate to complain, and to complain loudly and insis- tently-," they warned in a statement. In 1909 a lynch mob terrorized African Americans in Springfield, Illinois. A small group of what reformers, shocked at the v iolation of African America rights, offered their support. Together with Du Hois, 2XJ ♦ Unit 4 ▲ During the war, women filled many jobs previously held by men. This woman is using a blowtorch in a Detroit factory. Mexican Immigration Increases Mexican Americans also benefited during World War I. To make up tor the shortage of laborers in agriculture, the government encouraged immigration from Mexico. Between 1917 and 1920, at least 100,000 Mexicans came to the United States. Many left their country of birtli to escape the fighting and upheavals caused by the Mexican Resolution. Most of the new arrivals settled in Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. Many took jobs as migrant workers, traveling from farm to farm, pick ing crops as they ripened. Others worked as miners or railroad workers. Still others settled in the cities of the Southwest. There many moved to Latino neighborhoods called barrios. In the barrios, the newly arrived Mexicans lived among relatives and friends. For Mexican Americans whose families had lived in the United States for a generation or more, the war meant new opportunities. It provided a first chance to get skilled factory jobs that paid good wages. Mexican American women found jobs in garment factories, fish canneries, and food processing plants. Meanwhile, thousands of Mexican Americans left the Southwest tor better jobs elsewhere. They moved to dries such as Chicago, St. 1 amis, and Omaha to work in meat packing houses, railroad yards, and factories. African Americans Like other Americans, most .African Americans it home supported rhe war. They agreed with NAACP founder W.F..B. Du Bois, who argued, "If this is our country, then this is our war." The war provided opportunities for African Americans to improve their living conditions. Accelerating the wave of migration that had begun earlier, 400,000 African Americans left the South liar cities in the North during World War 1. During the war years, the African American population of Chicago doubled, while that of Cleveland increased by four times. Detroit's African .American population increased by six times. Because of the labor shortage, many factories, mines, and other businesses in the North were eager to hire African Americans for the first time. Before the war, industries such as packing houses and steel mills had very few African American workers. By 1918 about 20 percent of Chicago packing house workers were African Americans, Along with new opportunities, African Americans encountered the old discrimination. Most African Americans still worked in some of the lowest- paving jobs and lived in segregated neighborhoods. Although African American organizations, such as the NAACP and rhe Urban League, tried to help African Americans find decent housing, the task proved difficult. War or no war, residential segregation remained strong in rhe North. How did the labor force change during World War I? To rally public support tor the war.

Soon, thousands of people in the arts andm 548 ♦ Unit 5 As the United States tried to deal with unemployment and labor strikes, old feelings of nativism and hostility toward foreigners were revived. These feelings produced tear of ideas and people considered "un-American" and resulted in new policies limiting immigration to the United States. The Red Scare Many Americans distrusted strikers because people associated their actions with communism, a political movement that had led to the overthrow of the Russian government in 1917. Communism called for government ownership of all goods and property and for turning over political power to farmers and workers. Proclaiming an end to all differences between social and economic classes, Communists started the Russian Revolution with massive strikes. Thus, many Americans worried that the workers' strikes of 1919 were the start of a Communist revolution in the United States. Widespread worries about a Communist takeov er fueled what became known as the Red Scare. Under pressure from Congress, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer decided to take action against the "Reds," as Communists were sometimes called. Beginning in the tall of 1919, Palmer's agents made mass arrests of suspected Communists. One of the largest roundups came in January 1920, when raids were carried out in 33 cities. About 3,000 people were arrested, some of whom were beaten and forced to sign confessions. Most of these were foreign-born individuals who wrcrc innocent of any crime. More than 500 people were deported, or sent out of the country, without ever being formally charged with or convicted of any crime. Palmer predicted that Communists would attempt to overthrow' the government on May 1, 1920, which was May Day, the international workers' holiday. The day passed, however, without any Communist attacks. As a result, people began to lose faith in Palmer and tor a while, the Red Scare faded away. However, applying the label "un-American" or "Communist" to a proposed reform program was enough to ensure its cancellation. Consequently, plans for state-supported bousing, health and unemployment insurance, and a social security system received little or no support. A fear of communism would continue to disturb the United States repeatedly until the general collapse of the Communist system in the 1980s. ▲ History During the 1920s. many Americans worried about a Communist takeover. Interpreting the Cartoon How did the artist convey the American people's fear of communism? Limits to immigration Sonic Americans believed that immigrants were taking jobs away from native-born Americans because the immigrants were willing to work for low wages. Fears about immigrants led the United States to change its immigration policy. In 1921, Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act. It set up a quota, or proportional share or allotment, for the number of people from each country that could enter the United States. Each year, immigrants from a nation were limited to 3 percent of the number of that nationality who were already living in the United States in 1910. The act also restricted the total number of immigrants to 357,000 each year. Until then, there had been no restrictions on immigration based on country of origin. Despite the new policy, and-immigrant sentiment continued to grow. In 1924 the National Origins Act further limited immigration. This law especially cur immigration from southern and eastern Europe while favoring immigrants from Britain, Scandinavia, and Germany. It also added the Japanese to the list of Asians wrho could not immigrate into the United States. In 1927, Congressman Albert Johnson from Chapter 18 ♦ J71 California expressed rhe attitude of many Americans toward immigration: The United States is our land. We intend to maintain it so. The day of unalloyed [pure] welcome to all peoples, the day of indiscriminate acceptance [admitting everyone] of all races, has definitely ended. The new immigration policies were a dramatic change from the past. The gates to the United States were now closed or, at best, open only a crack. Sacco and Vanzetti The intensity' of anti-immigrant feelings reached its height in the trial of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. In April 1920 robbers stole a shoe factory payroll in South Braintree, Massachusetts. A paymaster and a guard were killed. Two Italian immigrants were accused of the crime. A shoemaker and a fish peddler, Sacco and Vanzetti were carrying guns when they were arrested, and Sacco's gun was the same model used in the crime. Both were convicted and sentenced to death. Many Americans protested that the trial was unfair. The two men admitted to being anarchists, opposed Many Americans believed that the Sacco and Vanzetti trial was affected by hostility toward immigrants and fear of the men's political beliefs.

Many people believed the prosecutor paid more attention to their heritage and political ideas chan to evidence regarding their involve ment in the crime. Even the judge was openly prejudiced, having commented to a friend that he was "bound to comict these men because they were 'Reds." When the Massachusetts Supreme Court refused to retry the case, Sacco and Vanzetti were executed in 1927. Vanzetti protested his innocence up to the moment of his death. A writer who visited him wo days before his execution reported him as saying, This is our career and our triumph. Never in our full life could we hope to do such work for tolerance, for justice, for man's understanding of man as we now do by accident. What contributed to the growth of anti-immigranl feelings alter World War I? Beginning about 1910, African Americans started migrating from the rural South to the cities of the North, as shown on the map on page 373. They 572 ♦ Unit 6 Their diet consisted of little more than pork leftovers, cornmcal, and even weeds. Most survived on SI50 to $250 a year, but often much of that money went to the landowner. As the depression dragged on, the government began to pay landowners not to plant crops because it was thought that with fewer crops on the market, prices would rise. Most landowners decided that the unplanted land should be the land used by the tenant farmers. In response to this decision, some African American tenant farmers formed the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. Landlords hired thugs to break up the meetings, and many tenant farmers were thrown off the land where they had worked and lived tor many years. The early 1930s saw a revival of racial violence in the South, and African Americans were faced with growing discrimination. Documented lynehings increased from 8 in 1932 to 28 in 1933. Some white .Americans declared openly that African Americans had no right to a job if whites were out of work. African Americans were denied civil rights, such as access to education and voting. For African .Americans in the South, there was little justice. For example, in March 1931, nine young African American men—eight of them teenagers—w ere accused of attacking two white women on a train near Scottsboro, Alabama. Although there was no evidence of the attack, an all-white jury convicted all nine of the so-called Scottsboro Boys. Fight were sentenced to die. The Scottsboro Boys became a nationwide symbol of injustice. In 1932 the Supreme Court overturned the conviction. All of the Scottsboro Boys eventually gained their freedom, though the last was not released until 1950. How were African Americans affected by the Great Depression? During the Great Depression, many Americans looked for scapegoats, or people to blame. Mexicans and Mexican Americans, as well as other groups,often became targets for prejudice and mistrust. Public resentment focused on migrant laborers, who traveled from place to place in search of work. Since the Civil War, Mexicans hail been crossing into Texas to harvest cotton. After World War I they also traveled to California to harvest crops there. Jobs were so scarce that these African Americans drove from Memphis, Tennessee, to rural Arkansas just to work for a day in the cotton fields. ► 388 ♦ Unit 6 as this Mexican family, traveled the country searching for work. During prosperous rimes, Ameriean growers had encouraged Mexican workers to emigrate to the United States. Over the veal's, many of them had settled in California. Then the Great Depression struck, and farm jobs became scarce. Many migrants worked fewer days and for lower wages than in previous years. Increasingly, women and children were forced to work in the fields when work was available. Other farm laborers began to complain that Mexican farm workers were taking jobs from them by accepting lower pay. Many Mexican immigrants settled in cities. Communities flourished in midwestern cities—such as Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; and Gary, Indiana—as well as in cities in Texas and California. Many of the immigrants alternated between agricultural and factory work, depending on what jobs were available. Racism and segregation confined them to poor areas where disease and infant mortality rates were much higher than average. Mexican Americans, who were citizens of die United States, faced many of the same resentments as did Mexican workers. Despite having families that had been in the United States for several generations, they were regarded as illegal aliens, foreigners who had no right to live and work in this country. Only a relatively small number of Mexican Americans owned land. but many of them lost their property' because they were unable to pay taxes. Mexican Americans who had jobs in meat-packing plants, in steel factories, and on railroads found themselves working only a few days a week. As the economic problems of the Great Depression increased, resentment against Mexican Americans grew. Mexican Americans who had jobs were accused of taking work away from "real" Americans.

MT I^HMMMMi Chapter 19 ♦ 389 The 1930s saw the first serious effort to improve conditions for Mexican American workers. During the 1930s, Mexican Americans formed organizations to help them gain their rights. Mexican Americans Fight to Win Rights When the Great Depression began, many Mexican Americans worked as migrant workers. Most had not lived long enough in any one state to quality for government benefits. The terrible conditions of migrant workers continued long after the Great Depression. Citizens of Mexico living in the United States did not tare much better. Since they were not U.S. citizens, they were not eligible for many New Deal benefits. Unemployment among Mexican Americans in the 1930s was high, as farm production fell and the number of jobs diminished. As jobs became scarcer, prejudice grew. People from the Dust Bowl region arrived in California and Arizona desperate tor work. They competed for jobs with Mexicans and Mexican Americans. Mexican workers had been welcomed as a source of cheap labor in the past, but now many people complained that these migrant workers took jobs away from American citizens. Competition among workers drove wages down to eight or nine cents an hour. Although some agencies hired thousands of Mexican Americans for construction and cultural programs in the Southwest, they received little government help overall. As a result of this widespread prejudice, thousands ofMexican families were uprooted from their homes. .As man\ as 500,000 people were sent back to Mexico. This repatriation program was supposed to be voluntary. Rut many of the children sent back with their families had been born in the United States. That made them U.S. citizens, but the government did not respect their rights. Forced from the United States, they crossed the border back into Mexico with bitter feelings. The Strawberry Strike One New Deal protection that did not apply to migrant workers was the right to organize into unions. When migrant workers began to organize, they often met with resistance from farm owners. In May 1933, Mexican strawberry pickers in El Monte, California, went on strike. Their demand was to be paid 25 cents an hour. When strikers showed up to picket, police arrested them, and they were charged with disturbing the peace. Still, the strike continued. As strawberries rotted in the fields, the owners finally offered 20 cents an hour. The pickers accepted. Although this was not as much as they had demanded, at least the owners had given them the protection of a contract. It would be at least 30 years until migrant workers were able to win the right to organize their own union. ? How did the repatriation program affect Mexican families living in the United States?

The movement that resulted sometimes led to problems. Some rural towns lost their vitality as people moved away. Other areas, especially around large cities, became overcrowded. As often happens in uncertain times, prejudice boiled over as racial and ethnic groups that knew little about one another were thrown into close contact lor the first time. More than 27 million Americans relocated during World War 11—the largest internal migration in the nation's history. Since main' war industries were located in the West, the population surged there. During the war, the West gained about 8,000,000 people, three quarters of them from the South, hi the 1940s, California's population rose by more than 50 percent. Despite the wartime migration, in some ways Americans were more united than ever before. They formed organizations to w atch for enemy planes or to patrol neighborhoods to make sure wartime restrictions were observed. They joined the Red Cross to help soldiers who were sick or wounded. In informal groups they knitted clothing for refugees or sorted scrap metal. People in many communities, when their long workdays were over, served on ration boards and draft boards without pay. But the changes brought about by the war also created social upheaval and tensions. One government report in 1943 observed. The whole pattern of our economic and social life is undergoing drastic changes, without so much as a bornb being dropped on our shores. For example, as thousands of defense workers crowded into cities, critical housing shortages developed. The competition for scarce housing often intensified racial tensions and even resulted in riots. In Detroit, one such riot left 25 African Americans and 9 whites dead.

Despite some whites' objections, about two million I African Americans worked in defense jobs at a time when the African American population was just over 12 I million. From 1940 to 1944, the number of African American skilled craftworkers and managers doubled. As African Americans gained a foothold in the workplace, they became even more determined to acquire their lull rights. During the war, African Americans in the U.S. military said they were working not for just one "V," or victory, like other Americans, but for a "Double V"—victory against the Axis and against inequality at home. An African American woman later explained what the war meant to her and other 1 African Americans: r Everything started opening up for us. We got a chance to go places we had never been able to go before. In ways it was too bad that so many lives were lost. But 1 think it was for a worthy cause, because it did make a way for us. 1 ? What advances were made toward equality for African Americans during World War II? Like African Americans, Latinos found new opportunities on the battlefield and in the workplace. The demands ofWorld War II provided employment for many Latinos. Latinos in Combat and in the Workplace Approximately 500,000 Latinos served in the LTnited States military during World War II. Among them were 400,000 Mexican Americans and 65,000 Puerto Ricans. About a quarter of the soldiers who endured the Bataan Death March were Latinos. .All together. Latinos volunteered for military duty at a higher rate than any other group in the LTnited States. Latinos in the armed forces distinguished themselves for countless acts of bravery. Horacio Rivero, for example, won several medals during the war and was later promoted to four-star admiral. In all, 17 Latinos won the highest U.S. military medal, the Congressional Medal of Honor. One of these soldiers was Sergeant Clcto Rodriguez, who attacked a Japanese position and killed 82 of its defenders. Other latinos contributed to the war effort on die home front. In World War II, Latinos began to work in shipyards in Los Angeles lor the first time. By war's end, some 17,000 worked there, helping to bring about the eventual U.S. victory. In 1942, when farmers and railroad operators in the United States found themselves desperately short of workers, die United States and Mexico teamed up to oversee a program that supplied farms and railroads with braccros, or visiting laborers, from Mexico. Some 250,000 braceros came to the United States between 1942 and 1947. They kept Americans fed and the trains running, both vital contributions to victory. Zoot Suit Riots Latinos also encountered discrimination as they entered workplaces previously closed to them. Tension between latinos and whites sometimes flared into violence. The most well-known incidents became known as the zoot suit riots. In the early 1940s, some young Latinos in Los Angeles favored a style of clothing called a "zoot suit"—a king suitcoat with wide lapels and padded shoulders, and baggy pants that narrowed at the cuffs. A broad-brimmed hat completed the outfit. The zoot suit was a badge of pride in a part of Latino culture. Chapter 23 ♦ 475 The /(M"t suits quickly became a target for anti- Latino feeling. In 1943, white sailors on leave from ships in the port of Los Angeles clashed with young "zoot-suiters." In one major incident, a crowd of 3,000 whites beat several 1-atino youths. Incidents such as these made some white Americans re evaluate their prejudices. The federal government started the Spanish-Speaking People's Division to fight discrimination. This government office was not able to accomplish much, however. In the end, the zoot suit riots made latinos, like African Americans, even more determined to win the respect and equality they deserved. The American Gl Forum After helping to restore freedom in Europe, Latino servicemen returned to find little freedom at home. Instead, they met with signs reading "No Mexicans" in the windows of some restaurants and theaters. Jobs were again out of reach. One man in particular. Dr. Hector Garcia of Texas, stood up to this discrimination. A hero who had won a medal for courage on the battlefield, Garcia now applied his bravery to fighting for equal rights for all veterans. In 1948, he founded the American GI Forum to help all GIs, as soldiers and former soldiers were then called, to gain their rights GI stood for "government issue." The American GI Forum has gone on to become a nationwide organization, with 500 chapters in the United States and Puerto Rico. Although most of its members are Latinos, it has members of many ethnic groups. It has promoted fair education, employment, and voting. For Garcia's work in the American GI Forum, he was given the highest award that can be granted to an American civilian, the Medal of Freedom. In what ways did Latinos contribute to the war effort? Though World War It was a time of increased opportunity for many groups, for Japanese Americans it became a period of isolation and discrimination. After the bornbing of Pearl Harbor, many white Americans grew afraid that the 112,000 lapanese Americans living on the west coast might help Japan invade the United States. They ignored the fact that two thirds of these Japanese Americans were Geography Beginning in 1942, more than 100,000 Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps.

They are wearing identification tags on their coats. American citizens. Nor was there any sign that the Japanese Americans had participated in sabotage, or secret acts against the government. All the same, prejudice against Japanese .Americans was not uncommon. Since relatively few Japanese Americans lived in the United States, many white Americans had never met or become acquainted with them. This lack of understanding led some white Americans to believe that Japanese Americans might be spying for or aiding Japan in some way. On the basis of this unreasonable fear, in 1942 President Roosevelt issued an order allowing the army to remove west coast Japanese Americans from their homes and ship them to internment camps, or prison camps. Many families lost all they owned. The internment camps were located in barren I parts of the United States far from populated areas, as shown on the map on page 476. Conditions inside the camps were rough. Housing consisted of warped boards covered with tar paper. Each family shared one room in a crowded barracks building surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. Families hail almost no privacy. Food was poor, and water for personal use had to be I carried from a central faucet. For many of the interned Japanese Americans, the contrast between the life they were living and the rights they had lost was extreme. What made the contrast even more shocking was that while Japanese American families were being guarded behind barbed wire in the United States, many Japanese American soldiers were fighting bravely on the battlefields of Europe. Some families, while still living in internment camps, received medals given for the wounding or deaths of their relatives in combat. At last, beginning in January' 1945, the government allowed Japanese Americans in the camps to leave. It was not until 1988 that the United States government decided to make reparations. The government apologized to the Japanese Americans who had been driven from their homes. It also gave every survivor of the internment camps 520,000. It was an admission from the government that it had made a serious error. ? Why were Japanese Americans imprisoned during World War II? Section 3 Review Check Understanding 1.

Chapter 23 ♦ 477 insurance, banking, sales, and entertainment—anything that includes work done for others. Many such jobs arc referred to as white-collar jobs, after the white shirts that most male office workers wore during the early part of this century. In 1940, only about one third of American workers held white-collar jobs. By 1960 more than half of all American workers had jobs in service fields. A majority of those service jobs were considered white-collar. Left Out of the Prosperity Despite the general prosperity of the 1950s, not all Americans benefited. The gap between die rich and the poor grew wider during the 1950s. By 1957, one quarter of die population still lived in poverty. In 1960, one out of five Americans lived below the poverty level, then defined as a 4-person family with an annual income below $5,000. forty percent of American homes did not have a private bathroom with hot running water and a llush toiler. Although many poor people were elderly and white, the burden of poverty tell heavily on African Americans and Latinos, who earned only about 60 percent of the income of white workers. Many Latinos had to move from place to place to find jobs, earning low wages harvesting crops that could not be handled by machines. Native Americans who had lost their land often moved to the cities, where lack of job training kept them in low-paying jobs. It became increasingly difficult for those with little formal educarion to find steady work that paid well. The unemployment rate for African Americans, I aatinos, and Native Americans was often nearly double the rate for whites. Many' Americans were not aware of the widespread poverty in which African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, and many rural whites were forced to live. As the middle class moved to the suburbs, they left the poor behind in the cities. Writer Ralph Ellison summed up the experience of many African Americans in his 1952 novel. Invisible Man: I am an invisible man. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. While millions of Americans enjoyed the affluent life, a sense of resentment grew among poor Americans. They could see the wealth around them, but they could not get it for themselves. No massive social welfare programs like those of the New Deal were introduced to help them break out of poverty. Why were many Americans unaware of widespread poverty during the 1950s? The yrears after World War II saw huge changes in the way people lived in the United States. The American population grew, and many people moved. The places in which people lived, both cities and towns, were changing, too. Finally, the roles of women and men changed in surprising ways. Baby Boomers .After World War II, the population of the United States increased dramatically. Marriage rates surged is soldiers returned home. Confident that the had times were behind them, many married couples started families. Births per year increased from about 2.5 million in 1940 to more than 4 million in 1955. This increase in the birth rate began in 1946 and was called the baby boom. Before it slowed in 1964, it created the largest population increase the United States had ever known. Just as die prosperity of the 1950s encouraged people to have children, the large number of new Social Issues As suburbs developed, Americans moved out of the cities. Interpreting the Graph Where were most Americans living by 1960? ▼ 514 ♦ Unit 8 children fueled economic growth. Businesses rushed to provide services for this huge new market created by "baby boomers," as these children were called. Builders constructed thousands of schools, books on child care were written by experts like pediatrician Dr. Spock, and teachers were in great demand. Growth of the Suburbs As their families grew, Americans of the 1950s wanted their own homes. Using the GI Bill, mans' families of veterans were able to get loans to buy houses. They soon created a huge demand for housing, which builders struggled to meet. One way to do so was to build in the suburbs, the communities around urban areas. Thus, after World War II, the suburbs became the fastest-growing part of the American landscape. On average, some 3,000 acres of land were bulldozed for new suburbs every single day during the 1950s. By 1960, one out of four Americans lived in these communities, as shown on the graph on page 514. One development that set the pattern for suburban growth was Levittown. In 1946, builder William Levitt bought a large piece of farmland on Long Island, near New York City. He divided it up and built 17,450 homes—a completely new community— which he named "Island Trees." The name was later changed to Levittown. Levitt made his houses affordable by borrowing Henry Ford's principles of mass production and applying them to home building. Entire rows of houses were built using the same plan. Kitchens, bathrooms, and bedrooms in each house were nearly identical. Workers put the same type of oven in every kitchen and put up wall coverings that came in ready- made sheets. With these shortcuts, houses could be built .it weeks, not months. Most of the houses looked alike, but buyers did not mind. They were happy to have a home of their own. A 1947 Levitt home cost 57,990, and the demand far exceeded the supply. The surge to the suburbs created great opportunities for businesses. Before the 1950s, suburbanites had to travel to the city for shopping, medical care, and entertainment. Now, they could find all the goods and services they needed close at hand as stores, offices, and hospitals sprang up nearby. A few of the new suburbs were open to people of all backgrounds, but most were not. Secret rules often barred house sales to African Americans, Italian Americans, Latinos, and Jews. The Levitt organization ▲ Houses built in Levittown had two bedrooms, a fireplace, and a built-in TV. One tree was planted every 28 feet along each street. publicly refused to sell houses to African Americans until forced to do so by the U.S. courts in the mid-1960s. The 1959 play A Raisin in the Sun, by the African American playwright Lorraine Hansbeny, deals in part with the problems an .African American family faces in trying to move from Chicago to a mostly white suburb. Changing Cities As middle-class city dwellers moved out, the cities began to lose income from the loss of tax revenue. City' governments could no longer afford to provide many public services. Some large cities suffered a decline in total population during the 1950s, something that had never happened before in the LTnited States. Among them were Detroit, St. Louis, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the trends that had led poor people to leave farms and come to the cities were continuing. For example, about 1.85 million African Americans moved from the rural South to the cities of the North during the 1950s. With the flight of the middle class to the suburbs, the central cities more and more became home to the very rich and the very poor. Slum neighborhoods grew. As the slums spread, federal, state, and local governments responded by completing hundreds of Chapter 25 ♦ 5/5 called the Great Society. He had several goals for his first fiill term, including more federal aid for housing, no-cost medical insurance for the elderly, and federal aid to make a college education more available to poor people. He also wanted to change the immigration laws to allow more people from Asia, eastern Europe, and Latin America into the country. Johnson accomplished most of these goals. By 1966, he won approval for urban redevelopment and aid to education, as shown on the graph on page 563. By 1968, he had sponsored bills providing housing assistance, further aid to education, and conservation. Medicare and Medicaid One of the most important of Johnson's Great Society programs was Medicare, low-cost health insurance lor people over 65 years old that helps pay for such health care costs as hospital bills and doctors' care. The Medicare bill, passed in 1965, was the first major change in the Social Security system since 1935. Medicaid was another Great Society health program. While Medicare supports the elderly, Medicaid provides assistance to low-income and disabled Americans. Under it, the federal and state government pays for doctors, treatment in clinics, prescriptions, and some nursing-home care, dental care, and eyeglasses. Reform in Immigration and Voting Rights The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was an attempt to change an immigration policy that had been in effect since 1924. That older policy had established a quota system that favored immigrants from countries in northern and western Europe over those from other countries. Many immigrants from Asia were prohibited from entering the country. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 altered the quota system. Effective July 1, 1968, 170.000 immigrants from the Eastern Hemisphere and 120.000 from the Western Hemisphere were allowed to enter the United States each year. It established guidelines for entry based on skills the immigrants possessed or need lor political asylum, protection from oppression by rulers in one's homeland. The act allowed many more immigrants to come to the United States from Latin America, Asia, and eastern Europe. The old system of controlling immigration based on trying to keep the United States primarily a European American nation came to an end. In 1965, Congress also passed the Voting Rights Act. The act was largely a reaction to the violence faced by African Americans who attempted to register to vote in some places in the South. This law created widespread reforms in the nation's voting laws. l iteracy tests could no longer be used to keep people from voting. The Voting Rights Act led to increased voter registration in the South. This resulted in the election of many more African American candidates to local and state offices. What different groups of people benefited from Johnson s Great Society program? Along with the reforms of the Johnson administration came a series of Supreme Court decisions that supported the Great Society. They ushered in a new era of active Supreme Court involvement in the social changes of the 1960s. Additionally, the racial makeup of the Court was diversified w hen, in 1967, Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall as the first African American Supreme Court Justice. Leading the Supreme Court in these landmark decisions was Chief Justice Eari Warren. Warren was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1953 and remained there until 1969. He was such an important force in the Supreme Court rulings of the 1960s that the Court came to lx* known as tlx* Warren Court. The Warren Court made sweeping Supreme Court decisions.

The largest Latino groups are Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans. There are also sizable communities from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and other countries of Central America, latinos came by themselves or with their families to live in the United States. About 90 percent of them live in large cities. In the 1960s and 1970s, the I-arino population in the United States increased faster than that of any other group, but its development as a political force grew more slowly. Like other ethnic groups, latinos faced widespread discrimination in jobs, education, and housing. Mexican Americans arc the largest group of latinos in the United States, making up about 63 percent of the latino population. Mexicans have a long history in the United States. Many lived in California and the Southwest even before those lands became part of the United Stares, but the annexation of Texas and the U.S. victory in the war with Mexico made them a minority in a dominant Anglo, or English- speaking, society'. While Mexican heritage is still strongest in the Southwest and California, there arc large Mexican American communities in Chicago, New York, Milwaukee, and other LIS. cities. The civil rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s encouraged voters to exercise their rights. In the early 1960s, voters in Texas, California, and New Mexico elected the first Mexican Americans to the House of Representatives and the Senate, including Joseph Montoya and Henry B. Gonzalez. President Lyndon Johnson also named several latinos to important government positions, and in 1974, voters in two states elected Mexican Americans as governors— Jerry Apodaca in New' Mexico and Raul Castro in Arizona. During Nixon's administration, which began in 1969, Romana A. Banuolos was appointed treasurer of the United States. Latino political gains were not always accompanied by economic gains. Limited job opportunities forced some Latinos to work as migrant farm laborers, traveling from form to firm and living in temporary shacks. They spent days in the hot sun, picking fruit or vegetables for very low pay. Children, who worked long hours in the fields, did not go to school. Cesar Chavez, a leader in the struggle for latino civil rights, helped migrants improve their Working conditions. Cesar Chavez Leads the Farm Workers Like Martin Luther King, Jr., Cesar Chavez was committed to using nonviolent methods in order to achieve better conditions. He believed that actions such as strikes and boycotts could effectively bring about change. He also admired the Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi, who had preached nonviolence. Like Gandhi, Chavez used hunger strikes to gain attention and w in support. In 1962, Chavez began to fight for better labor conditions and higher wages for grape pickers in California. He organized a union that eventually became the United Farm Workers of America (UFW). In 1966, Chavez's group joined other workers in a strike against powerful California grape growers. Chavez and Dolores Huerta, another activist, led a peaceful march of workers from Delano, California, to the state capitol in Sacramento. As a result of the pub- licity', wine grape growers agreed to bargain with the union. However, the growers of table grapes refused. Chavez and Huerta then called for a boycott in 1968 of California-grow n grapes. Soon, people across Chapter 28 ♦ 5X1 the country knew about the farm workers' cause. An estimated 17 million Americans showed their support by refusing to buy the grapes. The boycott hurt business so much that table grape growers eventually gave in to workers' demands, ending die boycott in 1978. Future boycotts won better conditions for work ers w ho picked lettuce and other crops in California. Chase/ broadened the struggle tor better wages and union recognition into a campaign for workers' dignity'. The Chicano Movement like the black nationalists who were proud of their African heritage, Mexican American high school and college students took pride in dieir roots. They identified la raza ("the race" or "people") as the source of their common language, religion, and heritage. Calling themselves Chicano and Chicana instead of Mexican American to express dieir cultural nationalism, they demanded equality with Anglos. The Chicano rights movement was called cl ovimiento, or "the movement." Between 1965 and 1969, the Chicano movement reached its peak of activism. Students staged strikes in East Los Angeles high schools to demand Mexican American literature and history courses. They wanted to study writers such as Gary' Soto, Denise Chavez, and Rolando Hinojosa. In 1967 a group of students formed die Brown Berets, modeled on die Black Panthers, to address housing, employment, and other community issues. A cultural movement spread from college campuses into the latino community. This movement included literary journals diat were published and theatrical companies and music groups that toured across the country. Murals illustrating ethnic themes were painted on buildings in Los Angeles, Chicano nationalism inspired a variety of regional political movements in the late 1960s. Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales's Crusade for Justice was formed in 1965 to build Chicanos' political power and influence, and to foster cultural pride. The Crusade, which started in Denver, established a day-care center, a legal defense fund, a ballet company, a weekly newspaper, and a bilingual school. Bilingual means "using two languages." In Crystal City, Texas, Jose Angel Gutierrez formed the political party' La Raza Unida, or "the United People." It increased Mexican American representation in local government and established social and cultural programs. Efforts to provide self-help for Mexican Americans led to the founding of the Mexican American Legal ▲ Dolores Huerta (pictured above; and Cesar Chavez mobilized consumers to support better working conditions tor farm workers by boycotting grapes. Defense and Education Fund (AEM.DEF) in 1968 MALDEF provided educational services and legal hdp in civil rights cases. It also encouraged Chicanos and Chicanas to become lawyers and community leaders. ? What were the goals of the Chicano movement? The United States and Puerto Rico have had a unique relationship since the island became an American territory at the end of the Spanish- Amcrican War. In 1952, Puerto Rico became a commonwealth, a self-governing area, although it still maintained an association with die United States. Puerto Ricans elect their own officials, and they have a delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives who takes part in debates but does not have a vote. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and have many of the same rights and obligations, although they do not vote in national general elections or pay federal income tax During the 1940s and 1950s, as air travel became more affordable, more than 545,000 Puerto Ricans flocked to the mainland United States. Today about a third of the Puerto Ricans on the mainland live in New York City. New ark, Philadelphia, and Chicago arc other cities with large Puerto Rican communities. 5(Y2 ♦ Unit 9 President Nixon returned Blue I "ike to the Pueblo Indians in Taos, New Mexico, and backed Congress in granting Alaskan Native Americans legal tide to 40 mil lion acres and compensation of nearly $1 billion. Despite these victories, tribal lands continued to suffer from industrial and government dumping and other commercial uses. The 1960s marked the beginning of a Native American renaissance. Books like Vine Deloria, Jr.'s Custer Died for Your Sins (1969) and Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (1971) joined John Neihardt's Black Elk Speaks (1932) to reach millions of readers inside and outside Native American communities. These successes inspired other works about Native American life that also attracted large audiences. What actions did Native Americans take to create a change in government policies? Americans of Asian descent arc even more diverse than those of Latin American descent. They speak many different languages, follow different religions, and have different traditions. Discriminated against by polio, and law, they joined the civil rights movements of the 1960s in an attempt to end die prejudice they faced. Asian Immigration The Immigration Act of 1965 enabled increased immigration from Asia. In the 1970s alone, more than 1.5 million Asians arrived in die United States. This new wave also brought a strikingly different group of Asian immigrants. In 1960, the Asian American com- munin' was primarily composed of Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos. However, by 1990, the Asian American population also included a significant percentage of Koreans, Asian Indians, Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians. Many of these Asians had been able to come to the United States during the 1970s as a result of polices in the Immigration Act of 1965. Getting used to life in the Linked States was often difficult. Like earlier immigrants, some newcomers met with hostility and prejudice. Some local workers and business owners resented competition from these Asian immigrants. To feel more at home, new immigrants settled near friends and relatives. Large cities—such as New York, Seattle, Minneapolis, and Los Angeles— soon included Asian neighborhoods. A Wartime Legacy The discrimination that Americans of Japanese descent faced during World War II continued into the 1960s. It was one of the first issues taken up by In the late 1970s, many Vietnamese immigrants, such as the ones shown here, made part of the journey to the United States on flimsy, overcrowded boats. ► j ft * F TM V i ML . i ▲ In 1964, Patsy Takemoto Mink became the first Asian American woman in Congress. the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), a civic group formed by nisei (ne'-sa), or second- generation Japanese Americans. The JACL became a leading organization working for .Asian American civil rights in the 1960s and 1970s. It lobbied Congress to pay Japanese Americans for the financial losses they had suffered during World War 11. The Civil Liberties Act of 1988 included an apology and some payments to victims of internment. Joining the Civil Rights Movement When Hawaii became a state in 1959, it elected the first Asian American to the Senate, Hiram Fong. Senator Fong's parents had come to Hawaii from China. Representative Daniel K. Inouye was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Japanese American parents. In 1962, Inouye was elected to the Senate. In 1964, Patsy Takemoto Mink, a Japanese American, became the first Asian American woman elected to Congress. As civil rights movements gained steam in the 1960s, Asian students joined in the struggles. Students at San Francisco State College, for example, organized the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF), which included .Asian Americans, Latinos, and African Americans. In November 1968, the TWLF asked for and won a school of ethnic studies at the college. In many Asian American communities, students helped set up community^ centers and self-help groups. Some young Asian activists in San Francisco and New York, modeling themselves after the Black Panthers, became trade union organizers who attempted to raise the low wages of -Asian immigrants in the garment industry. Others led campaigns that reflected the diversity of the Aian American population. Filipino Americans, for example, organized to educate themselves and other Americans about the destructive role of U.S. backed Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Artists, writers, filmmakers, and his torians sought to honor the Asian American past as well as to advance their cultural identity. Fiction writers, such as Frank Chin, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Amy Tan, found large audiences both inside and outside their communities. After generations of discrimination, these writers began to forge an identity and pride that was characteristically Asian American. How did Asian Americans advance their fight for civil rights?

Mexican American communities in the Southwest include recent arrivals and families who have lived in the region for generations. Debating Immigration The large number of immigrants has reopened debate about the effect of the newcomers on the American economy. Some people argue that immigrants take jobs away from American citizens. They believe that the surge in immigration has strained the facilities that provide education, medical care, and welfare to U.S. citizens. Other Americans defend the role immigrants play in the economy. They point out that the newcomers often open new businesses. Some immigrants arc highly trained doctors, engineers, and scientists. Nearly 30 percent of the Americans w ho have won Nobel prizes in chemistry, physics, and medicine were born in other countries. In addition, American culture has been enlivened by the foods, music, dances, art, fashions, and customs that people have brought from around the world. Immigration has changed our sense of who we are as a nation. In earlier times, immigrants were encour- aged—sometimes forced—to give up the language and customs of their native land. Today, many Americans accept the idea that theirs is a multicultural land, one that is marked by cultural diversity'. Others have questioned the notion of ethnic identity. They argue that people should not think of themselves as Chinese Americans, African Americans, German Americans, or Cuban .Americans. They say that ethnic traditions should be discarded and that the people of this country should think of themselves as Americans. They believe the nation should enipha size the rights of individuals rather than the rights of groups. Some say that people in a culturally diverse society can observe their individual traditions and still accept the principles of democracy upon which the United States was founded. One's cultural heritage can be respected, while the continually evolving American traditions and customs can be shared. What differing positions have Americans taken toward multiculturalism? .As Americans enter the twenty-first century, they can take pride in their accomplishments. Their nation is strong.

Most Americans are descendants of people who came from other countries. While many American citizens believe that we should continue to welcome immigrants to the United States, others want to limit the number of newcomers who are permitted to enter. In the first passage below, Spencer Abraham, U.S. senator from Michigan, supports immigration. In the second excerpt, Yeh Ling-Ling, himself an immigrant, calls for curbs. Roth writers focus on how immigration afreets the economy of the country. Immigrants are the ultimate entrepreneurs. They are people willing to risk it all in a new and different land. Immigrants also create a "brain gain" for the United States. Highly-educated, highly-skilled immigrants are essential to the competitiveness of America's high-tech industries. After recruiting on American campuses, these companies still do not have enough highly-skilled engineers, scientists, and computer specialists. Only because their need is real do companies go through the trouble, expense, and government paperwork necessary to hire foreign workers. Sen. Spencer Abraham. Michigan Republican, from a letter published in the Almost every week, we hear about thousands of our workers losing their jobs. Yet in 1992. more than 750,000 legal immigrants of working age were admitted to this country. In addition, we admit annually more than 60,000 foreign professionals on extended work visas. Many of these "temporary workers" enter skilled occupations, such as computer programming and engineering, where there have been massive layoffs. If the United States continues with an immigration policy that operates as if we had a labor shortage, how can we expect unemployed Americans and welfare recipients to find jobs?
