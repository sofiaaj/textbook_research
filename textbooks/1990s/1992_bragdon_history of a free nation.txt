By the turn of the century, however, most of the millions of "new" immigrants were from eastern and southern Europe, notably Russia and Italy. But regardless of the country of origin, reasons for coming to America remained much the same, freedom from political unrest and economic opportunity. British textile industry brought prosperity to the deep South. In the 1850s, cotton production broke all previous records. By 1860 seven-eighths of the world's supply of cotton came from the United States, and raw cotton comprised three-fifths of the nations exports. The 1850s also witnessed a revival of tobacco farming. A discovery by Stephen, a black overseer in North Carolina, led to a new method of "curing," or preparing, tobacco, which greatly increased the yield and quality of tobacco crops. Yet despite these advances, the South did not experience the industrial expansion enjoyed by the North. Eventually the West would follow the North and surpass the South in its move toward greater industrialization. Increased Immigration Fuels Factories One of the necessities for sustained industrial growth is a sizable labor supply. Until about 1800, immigrants came to the United States at a rate of about 8,000 per year. During the second quarter of the nineteenth century, however, a great migration from Europe to America began. Between 1840 and 1860, an average of more than 200,000 immigrants reached American shores every year. The reasons for this were both political and economic. Thousands of immigrants made the perilous voyage to escape poverty. Many English crafts workers, made jobless by the Industrial Revolution, sailed to America. The Scandinavians and the Dutch, whose native soil could not support rapidly growing populations, also came. So did the Irish, after a failure of their potato crop resulted in economic hardship and the starvation of thousands. Others, like the Germans, came to avoid political persecution. By 1860 one out of every eight Americans was foreign-born. European agents of railroad companies and steamship lines described America as a land where riches could be had almost for the asking. Several states established immigration agencies to attract northern Europeans; inducements were offered, such as giving the right to vote to newcomers even before they became naturalized citizens. Perhaps the most persuasive induceme I were the "America letters" written L recent immigrants to their families a a friends in Europe. One person wrote: The poorest families adorn the tables three times a day like a wedding dinner_tea coffee, beef fowls, pies, eggs, pickles, good bread.... Say, is it so in England? The move to America was difficult and dangerous. Immigrants were packed into overcrowded ships wfiere terrible conditions resulted in death from malnutrition and disease in an estimated 10 percent of the passengers. Unfortunately, the problems of the immigrants continued even after they had found jobs and places to live—immigrants were forced to confront the bigotry of some established Americans who resented their different languages, religions, and customs. Such resentment, along with the fear that immigrants would bring new and possibly radical political ideas into the United States, led to the formation of secret societies. One of these was a nationwide secret political society called The Order of the Star-Spangled Banner, founded in 1849. Nicknamed "Know Nothings" because members replied "I know nothing" when asked about their organization, they tried to keep recent immigrants from political office. They also demanded that immigration be restricted and that the naturalization period be extended to 21 years. In spite of such hardships and prejudice, immigrants continued to flock to the United States. Although some went West to its rich farmlands, many remained in the North, often in such port cities as New York and Boston, where their ships had docked. One reason for this was that they had little money to continue their journeys. Also the South already had a source of cheap labor—the black slave. The result was that immigrants supplied the Norths growing industries with a steady stream of low'-paid workers. Unit 5 Division and Reunion: 1825-1877 transportation Ties ^orth and West VGth rapidly expanding domestic and f i2n markets came great advances in ^nsportation. In the 1850s the United States built the largest merchant marine fleet in the world, inland navigation reached its peak, and on the railroads— the newest form of transportation—track mileage was increased threefold. In 1849 Great Britain repealed the Navigation Laws that had given special protection to British ships trading within its empire. The United States, however, continued to allow only its own ships to carry' cargo between American ports. Competing on even terms with British ships in British ports while enjoying an advantage in their own, United States ships increased in total tonnage from 943,000 tons in 1846 to 2,226,000 tons in 1857. The greatest triumph at sea for the United States was the clipper ship, which enjoyed its brief heyday between 1845 and 1860. Characterized by very sharp bows, an immense spread of sail, and masts 200 feet high, clippers soon became the fastest ocean-going sailing vessels ever built. The clipper Lightning once logged over 500 miles in a 24-hour period. Alarmed by the superiority of United States sailing ships, the British concentrated on the development of steamships. Between 1850 and 1860, the amount of ocean freight carried in steam vessels rose from 14 to 28 percent, and most of this increase could be attributed to British shipping. By 1860 United States shipyards, which could produce only sailing ships, were closing down. 220,000 Year Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 (1975) Examining Graphs Immigration into the United States from Great Britian, Ireland, and Germany increased dramatically between 1820 and 1860.

How was construction of the transcontinental railroad financed? rate of $16,000, $32,000, or $48,000 per mile, according to the terrain. Each company also received land grants along the right-of-way averaging 6,400 acres per mile. Construction proceeded rapidly as the two lines raced to get more government money and land. At the height of the competition, the Union Pacific builders employed 10,000 workers. Irish immigrant crews working for the Union Pacific and Chinese immigrants working for the Central Pacific sometimes laid as much as 6 miles of track a day—a remarkable feat because the digging and grading were done by hand. The Central Pacific had a difficult time in the Sierra Nevada ranges with snow that sometimes collected in drifts 60 feet deep. Its heavy equipment was carried from the East 19,000 miles around Cape Horn to California by a fleet of 30 ships. On May 10, 1869, the "wedding of the rails" took place at Promontory Point, Utah. The whole country celebrated as a transcontinental telegraph reported the blow of a silver sledge hammer driving a golden spike to complete the railroad. A magnetic ball dropped from a pole on the top of the Capitol in Washington, D.C.; in Chicago a seven-mile procession ed through the streets; in small towm^u! zens rang church bells. The first transcontinental line was followed by others—-the Northern p T the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa F • t' Southern Pacific; and the Great North Beginning in 1879, Janies J. Hill builtT Great Northern, connecting the stat f Minnesota and the Washington Terrir ° without government help. By encourap' settlement as soon as the rails were laid Hill assured that his line would have cm' tomers. He offered free transportation from eastern ports, credit, farm machinery, and even gave farmers free advice on how to improve crops. Hill's careful con struction of the Great Northern kept maintenance costs down and enabled him to charge lower rates. As a result, his railroad became the leading carrier in the Northwest. The railroads played a major role in the extermination of the buffalo. Formerly ranging eastward as far as Pennsylvania and the Carolinas, the buffalo's natural habitat was the Great Plains where they migrated north and south with the seasons. The Union Pacific Railroad effectively cut the huge herds in half. At first buffalo hunting supplied meat for railroad workers, but later it became "sport" for city vacationers to shoot the animals from train windows. In 1871 it was discovered that buffalo leather could be sold at a profit. Professional hunters killed millions for their hides. Train loads of bones were shipped east to make fertilizer or charcoal. By 1886 only a few hundred buffalo were left, deep in the Canadian woods. Plains Wars To protect their lands and to stop the waste of the buffalo, Plains Indians had to fight. For two and one-half centuries they had maintained their way of life against Spanish, English, French, and American invaders. The last battles against overwhelming forces proved futile. The military effort to remove the Indians from the plains was relentless with the Unit States spending an estimated million do- lars for each adult male Indian killed.

Nations Within a Nation (1987) Examining Graphs Census figures show a declining native American population before 1 goo. The United States army fought the plains Indians from 1869 to 1890. In what ten-year period did this fighting take its heaviest toll? The first concentrated fighting broke out in Colorado, just after the Civil War started in the East. Government officials tried to force the Arapaho and Cheyenne from an area that had been granted to them "forever" ten years earlier. Warfare continued for three years until Black Kettle, the Cheyenne Chief, was trapped at Sand Creek in eastern Colorado by Colonel John Chivington. The militia ignored Black Kettle's repeated attempts to surrender and killed men, women, and children. In 1862 the Santee Sioux of Minnesota attacked a group of white settlers who had moved into their hunting lands. After the militia defeated them, the Sioux were forced to move to Indian reservations in the Dakota Territory. A short time later, the Oglala [oh LGAH lah] Sioux became enraged at the territorial government's phns to build a road through their sacred lands. Led by Red Cloud, they successful} resisted for several years. In the end, owever, the Sioux lost their land to miners Marching for gold in the Black Hills. After the bloody war with the Sioux, humanitarians in the East called for a change of government policies. The United States divided responsibility for the native Americans between the Department of the Interior and the War Department. The Department of the Interior first was to placate Indians with gifts and to establish reservations; the War Department was to make war on those who resisted. In 1867 the federal government sent a peace commission to meet with representatives of several nations, including the Comanches, Kiowas [KY uh WOHS], Cheyenne, and Arapaho. This effort to end the constant warfare produced agreements that stipulated the Indians were to live on two major reservations on the Great Plains, Life of the Times Indian Schools In the 1870s and 1880s, the federal government passed legislation and instituted policies designed to assimilate native Americans into white society. Education f igured prominently in the plan for assimilation. If Indian children were removed from their parents and traditional cultures, the thinking went, they would more readily absorb the skills, knowledge, and values of white society. Most of the 106 Indian day and boarding schools operated by the federal government in 1881 were on or adjacent to reservation land. However, white educators believed that native American children would learn more and be assimilared more quickly if they attended nonreservation boarding schools. Native American parents showed reluctance to whites who came to recruit their children for boarding school. For example, parents were particularly reluctant to send their daughters away from home. They understood that it would change the children's values. One mother of an especially bright 10 year- old girl refused to let her daughter go off to an industrial training school without her. Education and civilization, the mother explained, would make the child regard her mother as a savage. In the end, this mother was allowed to accompany her child to school.

They talk of millions [of dollars] as confidently as formerly of thousands. —John Sherman U.S. senator, in a letter to General William T. Sherman, 1865 Section Focus The tremendous industrial growth that occurred in the United States after the Civil War resulted from foundations that had been laid over the previous half-cen- tury. As settlement reached beyond the Mississippi River, agriculture flourished in the South and Midwest, and manufacturing increased in the Northeast. A transportation network spread people, products, and information across the nation. Yet greater growth was ahead. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify and explain the factors that encouraged industrial growth. • Discuss the railroad's role in the growth of industry. Unlike the South, the North emerged virtually undamaged by the Civil War, its railroads and factories intact. Furthermore, the war and Reconstruction eliminated Southern planters as rivals to Northern industrialists for political power, allowing industrial growth to proceed at an even greater pace. Although interrupted by depressions in 1873 to 1878, 1882 to 1884, and 1893 to 1896, America's industrial production doubled every 12 to 14 years. By the 1880s the United States had overtaken Great Britain as the world's industrial leader. Although historians differ over the relative importance of the reasons for industrial growth after the Civil War, they generally agree that several factors combined to support its rapid development. Natural and Human Resources The United States contained tremendous deposits of the natural resources upon which industry depended—coal, iron ofe, and petroleum. Before the war, these deposits had scarcely been touched. By the 1860s, however, methods for extracting and utilizing these resources were well developed. Mineral resources were abundant in several regions of the country. The amount of coal mined in the United States more than doubled in every decade between 1840 and 1890. By the 1870s, vast deposits throughout the Appalachians from Pennsylvania to Alabama were being mined. Completion of the Soo Canal between Lake Superior and Lake Huron in 1855 allowed ships to move iron ore mined from large deposits in Michigan and Wisconsin to iron and steel mills on the lower Great Lakes. The American oil industry got its start in 1859 in western Pennsylvania when the first successful well was drilled. By 1900 oil fields extended as far west as Texas. Production had risen from 2,000 barrels per year in 1859 to 64 million barrels pet year in 1900. The human resources available t° American industry were as important as the mineral resources. European capitalist5 Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900 metimes had difficulty recruiting labor f0r new industries. Children of working c]ass families often were raised to follow so. and in the Euro- ttaditional occupations, pean countryside peasants frequently were reluctant to leave their home villages. In . j c^" _ I I t ° /'TlI K/y r Txr'l c the United States, however, labor was more mobile. Workers came to new jobs ;n cities the way pioneers moved to new lands. Between 1860 and 1890, America's population more than doubled, rising from 31 million to nearly 75 million. The flood of immigration that had begun in the 1840s continued, contributing to this growth. Pulled by opportunities in America—and pushed out by the lack of them at home—14 million immigrants arrived between 1860 and 1900, more than twice the number of the previous 40 years. Many of these immigrants were adult males, eager to find employment. These newcomers enlarged the labor pools that gathered wherever jobs were available, which helped keep industrial wages low. Public Policies and Private Investment American industry developed within a free enterprise system. Whereas European governments exerted controls over manufacturing and trade, Americans embraced a philosophy of laissez-faire, which comes from the French phrase meaning "let alone." As a result, American industries developed with few government restraints. Some government policies actually encouraged industrialization. American entrepreneurs, or business organizers, sought and received special favors from Congress. Liberal immigration laws insured a steady supply of cheap labor. High protective tariffs encouraged American industries and raised manufacturers' profits by keeping out foreign goods. The federal government sold public lands containing vast mineral resources for a small proportion of their true values and assumed about one-third of the cost of building western railroads. It gave railroads grants of money totaling more than $700 million and gave them public lands throughout the West equaling the size of Texas. In the United States, business attracted and held people of high ability and ambition. While European entrepreneurs often retired when they acquired enough money to buy their way into the upper class, Americans regarded money-making itself as a worthwhile goal. "Such opportunities for making money," wrote Thomas Mellon, a Pittsburgh judge who became a banker, "never existed before in all my former experience." The money to be made in American manufacturing and transportation attracted private investors. The savings of New Englanders—accumulated from the West Life of the Times Working-class Tenements Working-class incomes varied greatly during the late nineteenth century. For example, in 1889 a carpenter earned $686annually; a laborer, $384; and a young girl in a silk mill, only $130. The carpenter ate meat or eggs, hotcakes, butter, and cake for breakfast. The laborer and silk worker had only bread and butter for two meals out of three. The carpenter lived in a comfortable, spacious house. Most working- class people like the laborer and the silk worker crowded together in tenements designed to house as many families as Living conditions in tenements Iwere primitive. Beds often consisted of boxes filled with straw. Few buildings had indoor plumbing, and in those that did, several families shared a bathroom. Living areas were cramped. Rags, bones, and other garbage piled up outside, freezing in winter and reeking in summer. Disease festered in the pervasive dirt and vermin. Working-class men and women developed a community life as vibrant as their physical surroundings were bleak. Frequently this life was based on ethnic ties. Irish Americans gathered in taverns and parish churches. Jewish Americans organized Hebrew schools and Yiddish-speaking literary groups. Most immigrant groups and African Americans developed social clubs, storefront churches, and mutual-aid societies. Chaptf. The Rise of Industrial America Linking Across Time The Changing Census of Labor Unions In 1955, the AFL merged with the CIO (Congress of Industrial Orga- nizations). The union retained its skilled labor, while extending membership to semiskilled and unskilled workers as well. Today, union members also included white-collar and college-educated members: teachers, musicians, retail workers, and radio and television artists. The AFL- CIO is the most powerful labor organization in America, boasting more than 17 million members— 78% of the nation's organized workers. Examining Photographs Union leaders hoped to improve conditions for workers such as these immigrants in a New York City tenement sweatshop. What were the difficulties that unions encountered in organizing immigrants? their wages slashed during depressions of 1873, 1882, and 1893. Workers looked to labor unions for protection. The Revival of Labor Unions The growth of labor unions during the early 1800s had been halting and sporadic, but conditions during the Civil War spurred the revival of unionism. With hundreds of thousands of workers serving in the army, unions were in a strong position to demand better pay. During the war, the number of local unions rose from 79 to 270. To strengthen local unions, labor also began to organize on a national scale. In spite of rapid growth during the Civil War and afterward, labor unions faced serious difficulties, including the mobility and diversity of the American labor force. Workers who did not "stay hitched," but moved from job to job were difficult to organize. The constant influx of large numbers of immigrants—averag- ing more than one-third of a million a year between 1870 and 1900—also presented a problem. Differences in language, religion, and customs among the immigrants made it hard to unite them into an effective union. Another problem was that di^S labor leaders had different soak 6 ■ Joirie leaders envisioned uniting all workers into one large union in order to - - rmrtiotj widespread reforms.

If found to h ^ been involved in union activity, a worke would be fired and often could not ot another job because of blacklists ° records kept by employers of "trouble, makers." Once blacklisted, a laborer could get a job only by changing residence, trade, or even name. Another way employers retaliated against union organizing in a workplace was the lockout— whereby the factory was shut down—or by firing union members and hiring scabs, or replacement workers. In any lockout or strike, the odds favored employers. Few unions had enough money to support their members through the long period of unemployment caused by a strike. Labor unions also had to fight public opinion. Many Americans viewed fixing Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900 Examining Illustrations The Railroad Strike of 1877 resulted in the most violent upheaval in the history of American labor. In several places, such as the city of Baltimore (shown here), there were clashes between troops and strikers. How did the strike originate? wages and hours by collective bargaining between workers and employers as violating the right of an individual to deal personally with the employer. Only infrequently did public opinion condemn employers when labor disputes resulted in violence. This happened during the Homestead lockout in 1892, when the Carnegie Steel Company hired a private army of 300 Pinkerton detectives armed with repeating rifles. Generally, however, labor unions were held responsible when disorder occurred. Another problem for unions was that law enforcement agencies usually sided with the employers. Employers suffered no penalties for lockouts and blacklists. Union strikes and boycotts, on the other hand, were judged to be "conspiracies in restraint of trade," for which labor leaders might be jailed or fined. Contracts between employers and unions were not usually enforceable by law. When violence occurred, or was even threatened, the police—and sometimes armed troops— were sent to the aid of employers. Railroad Strike of 1877 Despite these obstacles, labor unions survived—sometimes just barely. Union membership fluctuated according to business conditions. Following the panic of 1873, 5,000 businesses closed, causing widespread unemployment and homelessness. Union membership dropped from more than 300,000 to 50,000. Three million workers were unemployed. At this time there were no unemployment or relief benefits available from either the state or federal government. Tramps and hobos roamed the countryside; workers' rallies to demand relief were suppressed by mounted police. The hard times of the 1870s reached a climax in the railroad strike of 1877, which shook the nation as no labor conflict in its history had done before.

Individually, workers were powerless to change hazardous working conditions, low pay, and long hours. When little was done to improve their lot, workers in growing numbers came to accept the idea of forming new, better organized unions. Two important organizations were the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor. After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify two of the strongest labor unions of the late 1800s. • Evaluate the gains labor unions achieved during this period. people—skilled and unskilled, black j^j white, men and women, white-collar ana blue-collar—into one big union. The Knights of Labor and the AFL Unions At the head of the Knights of Labor Terence V. Powderly, an immigrant who roseYrom a railway switchtender to mayor of Scranton, Pennsylvania. An eloquent speaker and tireless organizer, Powderly had great hopes for the Knights: We seek and intend to enlist the services of men of every society, or every party, and every religion, and every nation in the crusade we have inaugurated against those twin monsters, tyranny and monopoly. Powderly persuaded the Knights to support equal pay for women, temperance, the abolition of child labor, and above all, the establishment of cooperatively owned industrial plants. A man of peace, he opposed strikes and wished to submit labor disputes to arbitration, that is, a process whereby an impartial third part)' helps workers and management reach an agreement. Membership in the Knights grew rapidly in the early 1880s—especially after the striking Knights won against Jay Gould's Wabash Railway. Membership in the Knights soared from 100,000 in 1885 to 700,000 in less than a year. Conservative newspapers feared that Powderly, the "labor czar," would become stronger than the President. The Knights of Labor, however, were soon swamped with troubles. The union had wasted its funds in unsuccessful attempts to set up cooperative businesses. Moreover, the effort to unite different kinds of labor into one big union had failed. Workers in different crafts and industries often had little in common with one another and little interest in working for the same goals. As industrialization was an urban phenomenon, so, too, were unions. Those states with the highest percentage of workers in industry had the greatest urban populations. It was in these industrial areas of the North and the Midwest that a score of new labor organizations were established in the late 1860s. By far the most influential was the Noble Order of the Knights of Labor. Founded in 1869, the Knights of Labor attempted to bring all laboring Section Two The Rise of New Unions —Samuel Gompers President of the American Federation of Labor, 1906 Section Focus Objectives Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900 t fig j |' If -;/ Examining Illustrations Membership in the Knights of Labor was open to men and women of all races. Here, Frank Farrell (left) introduces Terence Powderly, the founder of the union, at the Knights' tenth annual convention. What aims did the union strive to achieve for its members? The decline of the Knights was hastened by the Haymarket Square riot in Chicago on May 4, 1886. This event followed a peaceful meeting of some 3,000 workers who gathered together to protest the shooting of striking McCormick Harvester Company workers by the police. As the meeting was breaking up, someone threw a bornb into a group of police officers. Seven persons were killed and more than 60 were injured. Although the identity of the bornb-thrower was never established, 8 anarchist leaders were arrested and found guilty of taking part in the crime. Four were later executed for murder. Although the Knights of Labor could in no way be held responsible for the Haymarket affair, it became identified with radicals and violence. From then on, the Knights of Labor declined as rapidly as it had grown. In 1886, the year the Knights of Labor began to decline, the American Federation of Labor was organized. In its principles as well as its structure, the AFL differed greatly from the Knights. While the Knights had accepted a large number of unskilled workers, the AFL accepted only skilled workers. This policy indicated the reluctance of the AFL to accept women, African Americans and immigrants—the majority of whom were unskilled—into their union. Another difference was that the AFL organized workers into separate unions, each covering a particular craft. Each union managed its own affairs with only occasional help from the national organization. The AFL's fees were relatively high, in order to restrict membership, build up strike funds, and provide benefits to members and their families in cases of sickness, unemployment, or death. The AFL might never have enjoyed the success it did were it not for Samuel Gompers, its president for 37 years.

Another 14.5 million came between 1900 and 1915. Even more significant than the increase in numbers was the changing character of immigration during these years. The vast majority no longer came from northern and western Europe but from southern and eastern Europe. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Identify the reasons that immigrants came to the United States. * Distinguish between the "old" and the "new" immigration. The 13 colonies had been settled mainly by English setders. Other setders from Holland, Sweden, France, Scodand, Ireland and Germany came later. After 1815, however, increasing numbers of immigrants started to years arrive from Ireland. During these e j : irs, a total of only about 400,000 in^ grants had come to America. Begin the 1850s and continuing after the Civil War, immigration rose sharply. The "Old Immigration" During the period of "Old Immigr* tion," which started in the 1830s and reached a high point in the 1840s, there was a great wave of immigration to America's shores. Between 1840 and 1850, an additional 1.5 million newcomers journeyed to the United States Nearly one-half were from Ireland which was suffering from a potato famine. Between 1846 and 1860, about 1.5 million Irish immigrated to America settling in New York and Boston, which functioned as ports of entry into the United States. In the 1840s large numbers of Germans also began to come to America. Some left their homeland because of crop failures. Others came to escape political persecution after the failure of the Revolution of 1848. Still others were German Jews seeking religious freedom. Large numbers of German immigrants settled on farms and in cities in the Midwest—areas that were rapidly growing and had job opportunities. The Germans gave a distinctive flavor to such cities as Cincinnati, Milwaukee, and St. Louis. Then, in the 1850s, after the Gold Rush, Chinese immigrants began to come to the Pacific Coast. Many were hired to help build the railroads. About 100,000 Chinese had settled in the far West by the mid-1870s. During the colonial period, most immigrants were readily accepted. Workers were badly needed in all the colonies. In the 1840s and 1850s, however, some native-born Americans began to resent the newcomers, especially the Irish and German immigrants. The Irish in particular suffered discrimination. Some Americans resented them because they dressed and sounded "different" and because they were Catholics. Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900 The "New Immigration" Until the 1880s most newcomers had come from the nations of western Europe. After 1885, however, large numbers came from nations of southern and eastern Europe. The new immigrants were from Italy, Russia, and Poland, as well as from the nations of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. These newcomers were for the most part poor. They hoped to find a better life in America. In part, it was their labor that made the rapid industrialization °f the United States possible. For many Jews, Poles, and Czechs immigrating to tbe United States was the only way for them to escape persecution in their home- ^d. One Jewish immigrant noted that "the only hope for the Jews in Russia is to become Jews out of Russia." The new immigrants flocked to the cities. There they lived together in ethnically homogeneous neighborhoods such as "Little Italy" or the Jewish "Lower East Side" in New York City. There they practiced the ways of life they were used to and spoke their native languages. They recreated the churches, synagogues, clubs, and newspapers of their homeland and adapted them to their new environment. This huge influx of immigrants created special social problems. Because immigrants lived in their own neighborhoods, practiced their own customs, and spoke their own languages, many Americans wondered if they could ever be assimilated Chapter 19 Labor, Immigrants, and Urban Life Examining Graphs Beginning in the late 1800s, immigration from central, eastern, and southern Europe began to increase. In what year did immigration from those regions surpass the total from northern and western Europe? Examining Photographs An inspector examines the eyes of a newly arrived immigrant at Ellis Island. Some native-born Americans wanted to slow or stop immigration. At what groups was Lodge's proposed literacy test aimed? Life of the Times Italian Cuisine Between 1890 and 1910 about 2.7 million southern Italians immigrated to the United States. Coming from farms in Italy, they settled primarily in the cities on America's east coast. By 1920 New York City had become home to more Italians than there were living in Venice, Genoa, and Florence combined. Italian- Americans adjusted to many changes in their adopted country, and they adapted their cooking to substitute some more readily available ingredients. These Italian dishes became a lasting contribution to American culture. Pasta was enjoyed by everyone, sometimes several times a week. Macaroni, manicot- ti, spaghetti, and lasagna were first introduced to Americans by the little shops nestled among the blocks of tenements. Often macaroni or some other form of noodles could be seen drying in the windows. Italian bakery ovens produced the first pizzas, which had been a strictly Neapolitan item back in Italy. Opening in 1905, "G Lombardi" on Spring Street in New York's Little Italy became the first known pizzeria in the United States. Deep-dish, Chicago-style pizza, cooked in a black skillet, did not come along until 1943, when it was created by Ike Sewell and Ric Riccardo at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago. After World War II, the pizza industry boomed in the United States. Within 10 years there were few cities that did not have at least one pizzeria. into American life. Some people, especially workers, blamed them for low wages. Others resented that many immigrants were Catholics or Jews. The railroad strike of 1877 and the Haymarket Square riot of 1886 resulted in many people's fear of immigrants who, it was thought, believed in socialism and anarchism. A few politicians, notably Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, were strongly reactionary in their response to the issue of immigration. They wanted immigration from southern and eastern Europe to be stopped completely. In 1896 Lodge argued for a bill that would exclude all prospective immigrants who could not read or write 25 words of the United States Constitution in some language. Lodge concluded that such a test would: ... bear most heavily upon the Italians, Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks, and Asiatics... races most affected by the test are those whose emigration has... swelled rapidly... -And who are most alien to the great body of he United States. Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-1900 Examining Photographs During the late 1800s, "new" immigrants poured into the United States, braving the long and difficult journey to start a new life. Why did many people perceive these newcomers as a threat? In the late 1800s, hostility toward many of the new racial and ethnic groups coming into the new country grew. The differences in the customs, dress, and language of the new arrivals created a basic distrust of the foreign born by many native-born Americans. Some historians believe that this reaction was a response to the rapid changes occurring in America because of industrialization. For those native-born Americans who were uncertain and disturbed by social change, immigrants became easy targets of hostility. Some Americans formed groups to counter what they considered the immigrant threat. One of these groups, the American Protective Association, was founded in 1887 to protest the large number of Catholic immigrants. In some parts of the country, local laws were passed that prohibited immigrants from holding certain kinds of jobs and denied them other rights. Jewish immigrants, for example, were denied admission to some universities. In addition, the immigrants faced actual physical attacks. The anti-immigration movement was not limited to groups such as the American Protective Association. Some well- known scholars of the time were 568sus- ceptible to these feelings as well. Historian and future-President Woodrow Wilson and frontier historian Frederick Jackson Turner lamented the lessening flow of immigration from northern Europe and the rise in numbers of "inferior stocks"coming to America. One writer considered the new immigration a plot by European governments to "unload the sweepings of their jails and asylums.'' Anti-immigration sentiment was not limited to newcomers from Europe, however. The Chinese, too, suffered discrimination on the Pacific Coast. Discovery of gold in 1849 and the subsequent demand for cheap labor first brought the Chinese to Linking Across Time Modern Immigrants Today the flow of immigrants to America is higher than in any decade since 1900-1910. Six hundred thousand immigrants arrive yearly. Like those of the late 1800s and early 1900s, today's immigrants also come to escape oppression or to make a better life for themselves and their children. Unlike their predecessors contemporary immigrants come from Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America. In 1988, the Dominican Republic had the most entrants followed by Jamaica and China. Chapter 19 Labor, Immigrants, and Urban Life Examining Political Cartoons This anti-immigration cartoon, drawn by F, Victor Gillom in 1890, has the Statue of Liberty threatening to go back to France if the United States becomes an "immigrant dumping site." Which racial and ethnic groups encountered the strongest hostility? California. Many found work in the gold fields or on the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad. By 1852 there were some 25.000 Chinese men, women, and children living on the Pacific Coast and thereafter they came at the rate of 4,000 a year. By the end of the 1870s, there were almost 150.000 Chinese in California alone. Their willingness to work for low wages prompted a violent anti-Chinese movement among the white workers of California. Such feelings intensified during hard economic times. During the depression that followed the panic of 1873, unemployed workers in California attacked the Chinese. Some Americans began to demand that Chinese immigrants be excluded from the United States. In 1879 Congress forbade the importing of foreign workers under contract— a law aimed primarily at the Chinese. Then, in 1882, Congress, responding to pressure from the western states, suspended nearly all immigration from China for 10 years.

" __ANZIA Yezierska A Jewish girl who emigrated from Poland, 1901 Section Focus With the rise of industrialism, the landscape of the nation changed. Railroads crisscrossed the continent. Where farms once stood, factories spewed forth black smoke. Thousands of Americans left the nation's farms hoping to make their fortunes in the city. Millions of immigrants came to better their lives and share in the benefits of the new industrial age. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: * Identify the factors that led to the growth of cities during the late 1800s. • List the problems resulting from an increase in the urban population. All over the nation—but especially in the Northeast—cities were growing rapidly. This urban growth was a result of •odustrialization. In 1840, one out of WeU 12 Americans lived in a city with a Population of more than 8,000. By 1900, novvever, one out of every three Americans IVed in a large city. Why were so many people attracted to the cities? One reason was that rising new industries held out the promise of jobs and opportunity. Where else could immigrants—or other Americans for that matter—fulfill the "rags to riches" dream of making a fortune overnight? The cities of the 1890s held the promise of excitement and activity in contrast to the isolation of rural farm life. There were bright lights, running water, modern plumbing, museums, libraries, theaters, shops, convenient transportation, and countless things to do and see. City people found in the noises, the crowds, the excitements a charm they were unable to resist. Urbanization Between 1860 and 1900 American urban areas grew twice as fast as the total population. Chicago, which in the 1830s had been a frontier town with a few hundred residents, became a vast metropolis of almost 2 million people. New York became the second-largest city in the world. The day dreaded by Thomas Jef- ferson—when Americans would abandon farm life—was clearly on the way. The new industrial cities were essentially the product of the mines, the factories, the steamships, and the railroads. New cities appeared, or old ones mushroomed, near coal and iron deposits (Birmingham and Pittsburgh), near sources of water power (Lowell and Lawrence, Mas- sachusetts), shipping centers (Baltimore and New York City), and at railroad centers (Omaha and Chicago). Once established, cities seemed to generate their own growth. To serve industry, such facilities as banks, insurance companies, docks, and warehouses were developed. These, in turn, attracted more industry and workers. Immigrants, lacking the agricultural skill or money to buy a farm, could often find employment only in urban industrialized areas. In the big cities, too, immigrants often had relatives who spoke their native language and preserved their customs. But an even greater number of people who flocked to the big cities came from America's rural areas. They came not only Chapter 19 Labor, Immigrants, and Urban Life such varied positions and needed to be all things to all people: Wanted: a good, active Dimmycrat, sthrong iv lung an limb; must be...a sympathizer with th' crushed an down throdden people but not be anny means hostile to vested inthrests; must advocate sthrikes, govermint be injunction, free silver, sound money, greenbacks, a single tax, a tariff f'r rivinoo... at home in Wall sthreet an th'stock yards, in th'parlors iv th' r-rich an th' kitchens iv th'poor. Examining Graphs The Republicans dominated the presidency and often controlled Congress between 1860 and 1900. In which presidential elections did the Republicans win over 50 percent of the popular vote? Although fairly evenly matched in strength, the two parties were hardly identical. Though both parties received support from people in every walk of life, each had a distinctive base of support. The Republicans' base of support was a coalition of western farmers and merchants, who benefited from Republicans' internal improvements and liberal land policies, and Eastern businesspeople, who benefited from high tariffs and national 1860-1900 *1860 1864 1868 1872 1876 1880 1884 1888 1892 1896 1900 Republicans Democrats *ln 1860 Southern Democrats won 18% of the popular vote, the Constitutional Union Party 13% Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 (1975) Examining Photographs The Statue of Liberty torch, displayed in Philadelphia in 1876, symbolized freedom to new immigrants. Which political party were new immigrants likely to join? banks. As a group, the Republicans tended to be Protestants of old-immigrant stock—Presbyterians, Congregationdists, Methodists, or Baptists. The great problem of the Republican party was to keep together its eastern and western wings, which were likely to break into open warfare over such issues as greenbacks, free silver, tariffs, and banking. The Republicans' "patron saint" was Abraham Lincoln, whose birthday the)' honored with banquets and oratory. As the party that had led during the Civil War, they had great prestige in the North and West. "The party that saved the nation must rule it," they proclaimed. While critics attacked the Republicans for keeping alive war hatreds by "waving the bloody shirt," appeals to the memory of the Civil War were much more than that. Republican strength came from genuine devotion to the idea of the United States as a nation rather than as a federation of states. Many Republicans continued to be inspired by the partys early idealism. They felt that government existed to advance the public good. Democrats, too, looked back to the Civil War. From the end of radical Reconstruction until well into the twentieth century, southern states formed the so i Unit 6 The Emergence of Modern America: 1860-190 [ never wavering in its allegiance to So^ ocrats.

The Democrats had allies among western farmers, especially when prices for their crops were low', and among certain groups of businesspeople and owners of import companies w'ho favored a lower tariff. The Democratic party had two "patron sajnts"—Jefferson and Andrew' Jackson. Like these leaders, the Democrats claimed to represent the interests of ordinary Americans. The Democrats took issue with the Republican view of the United States as a nation. "This is no nation," said one Democrat. "We are free and independent states." In contrast to the Republicans' view that the federal government should take an active role in helping the needy and shaping national growth, the Democrats wanted to keep the federal government on a skimpy allowance and a short leash. "That government governs best which governs least" remained their motto, and it appealed to many Americans. The Democrats were so used to being out of office, according to the humorist Dooley, that w-hen writing their platform they forgot how to say "we commend" out automatically began to "denounce and deplore." During the entire period from 1865 to 1900, Democrats held the presidency for only two terms. Although they usually lost the White House, the Democrats were seldom far out of the running. Democratic candidates often Sot almost as many popular votes as their 'notorious opponents, and it was rare that e Republicans did not have to deal with "'nnocrats in control of at least one °use of Congress. Chapt----- — ~ Section One Review Summary In a society dominated by business interests, an uninformed and indifferent electorate ignored the corruption that pervaded all levels of government. Corruption was worst at local levels, where party political machines held power. The Grant administration, too, was shaken with scandals. It was not until the Pendleton Act of 1883 that civil service reform began. Though supporters of the Democratic and Republican parties differed greatly, their strength was almost evenly divided.

The United States Marine Corps collected the duties and divided them to support the Dominican government and to pay European debts. Many Latin Americans resented the interference of the United States. To charges of imperialism, Roosevelt replied that the United States had no more desire for Dominican territory than "a gorged boa constrictor might have to swallow a porcupine wrong-end-to." Still, the United States retained control over the finances of the Dominican Republic until 1941. Roosevelts successor, President William Howard Taft, continued Roosevelts policies, but with a shift of emphasis. Taft's secretary of state, Philander C. Knox, promoted American business interests abroad, with the slogan, "Every diplomat a salesman." In Latin America this "dollar diplomacy" resulted in increased sales of United States goods—including war- ships—and in efforts to increase American investments there. Although Taft described his brand of diplomacy as "substituting dollars for bul- lets," in Nicaragua he used both. In 1912 marines were sent to Nicaragua to install a government acceptable to the United States, to force acceptance of a loan from New York bankers, and to put the customs office under the control of a former United States colonel. Knox declared that the United States wished only to exercise "a measure of benevolent supervision." But the economic imperialism and armed intervention that he fostered increased the unpopularity of the United States in Latin America. Balance of Power in East Asia Roosevelt realized that the position of the United States in East Asia was weak. He called the Philippines the "Achilles heel" of American defense; they were easily vulnerable to attack by Japan. In China the United States lacked sufficient military power to enforce Hay's Open Door notes of 1899 and 1900.

From that point on, the Japanese moved quickly t0 establish an elected parliament, speed industrial development, and build 3 strong military establishment. Japan believed its manifest destiny was to expand onto the Asian mainland. In 1893 Japan established a protectorate over the independent kingdom of Korea and obtained Formosa and other islands off China's northeast coast. Japan had designs on the resource-rich Chinese province of Manchuria, in which Russia was already established. The Russians hoped to move into Korea. This clash of interest led to the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. American opinion was at first overwhelmingly pro-Japanese. The Russian tsarist government was unpopular because of its tyranny and persecution. America regarded the Japanese with an almost paternal air because of Commodore Perry's exploits and admired their rapid westernization. To the astonishment of the world, Japan won victories over Russia both on land and sea. By the summer of 1905, however, both countries were ready to make peace—Japan, because it was nearing the end of its resources; Russia, because of fear of revolution at home. The Japanese secretly asked Roosevelt if he would serve as go-between. After consulting the tsar, Roosevelt formally' offered to help make peace. Both nations accepted the President's proposals and sent diplomats to a peace conference in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in August 1905. The President induced Japan to give up claims for a money' indemnity, or payment Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914 , jamages, and Russia to give up the °r ^ern half of the island of Sakhalin S°ik' uh LEEN).

Now it was no longer Russian expansion that was most to be feared, but Japanese. Roosevelt himself believed that there was potential danger of war. Both Americans and Europeans were alarmed that the "yellow race" might overwhelm the "white race." This idea of a "yellow peril" was played up by sensation- seeking newspapers. Resentment against Japanese immigrants led to the segregation of Japanese children in California's public schools. In a complicated series of maneuvers, Roosevelt attempted to soothe Japanese anger, satisfy their ambition, save the Philippines from aggression, and show the Japanese that he was not afraid of them. The President persuaded California to stop discriminating against Japanese children. Japan in turn agreed to halt the emigration of laborers to America. This compromise, arranged in 1907 and 1908, was known as the Gentlemen's Agreement. To check Japanese expansion toward the Philippines, Roosevelt recognized Japan as dominant in Korea and Manchuria. At the same time, he attempted to impress Japan with American naval power by sending an American fleet to Tokyo during its voyage around the world in 1908. The resolution of the Russo-Japanese War was an example of Roosevelt's efforts to use arbitration rather than war to setde controversies. Although his bluster and statements of bravado made him appear ready to lead the nation to war over minor incidents, Roosevelt's actions were usually milder than his words. While he upgraded America's military power, he believed that the United States had an obligation as a leader of an interdependent world to act responsibly and to show restraint. Chapter 22 Imperialism Section Five Review Summary The personality and Big Stick policy of Theodore Roosevelt dominated the period from 1900 to 1908. He extended American influence over Venezuela and Argentina. Through the Roosevelt Corollary, he legitimized American intervention in the Dominican Republic and the Canal Zone. He even exerted influence in the imperial activities of Russia and Japan as peacemaker in the Russo-Japanese War. William H.

Section Three Limits of Progressivism ...[A]n American, a Negro, two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled striv- ings. ... The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife....He would not bleach the Negro soul in a flood of white Americanism. ...He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American, without being cursed and spat upon. —W. E. B. Du Bois Civil rights leader and professor at Atlanta University, 1897 Section Focus While progressivism resulted in many lasting changes, reform had its limits. Much progressive reform was based on traditional American attitudes about race, sex, and nationalism. When public attention turned to world affairs, and the progressive spirit began to wane, not all Americans had shared equally in the benefits of reform. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Describe progressive attitudes about immigrants and racial minorities. • Explain why black leadership changed. The achievements of progressive reform at the national level were less far-reaching than its successes at local and state levels. It was more difficult to create nationwide demands for reform than to organize effective campaigns on a sm-,11 The federal government .Cr government ^ "_ more difficult to prod into acti ^ Senate, chosen by boss-dominaM legislatures until 1913, was ° State conservative body.

The Supreme Court became somewh less conservative than it was in the as progressives Oliver Wendell Hoi (1902), Charles Evans Hughes (19^ and Louis D. Brandies (1916) w ' appointed to the Court. Yet the majority of justices seldom were willing to extend federal power into new areas. The Co demonstrated this reluctance when i declared unconstitutional a federal law providing workers' compensation for railroad workers in 1908 and a federal child labor law in 1918. Partly because of the attitude of the courts, many of the evils described by the muckrakers—child labor, city corruption, and industrial accidents, for example—were considered outside the constitutional sphere of the federal government's powers, making national reform of these conditions nearly impossible. The benefits of progressivism were spread unevenly in other ways, too. Many middle-class progressives feared labor unions almost as much as they did trusts. So although progressives worked with labor leaders to improve working conditions, few objected when businesses organized effectively to prevent unions in their plants—often with cooperation from local courts and police. Therefore, wage gains during the Progressive Era came only among skilled workers. The earning power of unskilled workers-—the largest part of the labor force—-actually dropped because prices increased more rapidly than their rates of pay. Reformers and Immigrants Among the many factors that held down the wages of unskilled workers was the continuing flood of immigrants Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-1914 to the United States, averaging one million a year during the Progressive £j.a_largely from southern and eastern Europe. This "New Immigration" caused widespread alarm, as immigrant men and women competed for unskilled jobs in American mines, mills, and factories. In addition, the newcomers seemed to have more difficulty fitting in to established American culture than the "old immigrants" from northern and western Europe. Pressure from labor-union leaders and such organizations as the Immigration Restriction League persuaded Congress in 1897, 1913, and 1915 to enact laws requiring all immigrants to pass literacy tests. All three laws were vetoed, but such a law passed over President Woodrow Wilson's veto in 1917. Many progressives feared the socialist ideas that immigrants brought from Europe. As middle-class reformers, progressives wanted to change capitalism not abolish it. Many also worried about preserving existing values and culture. Therefore, many progressive reforms weakened the political strength of immigrant numbers and instilled in newcomers what reformers thought were proper American values. Examining Photographs Progressives believed in compulsory public education to keep children out of factories and to provide them with proper values. Why did many states require high school students to study American history? Examining Photographs Many businesses organized English classes for their employees and held them in the plant so that workers could attend at the end of their shift. Why would employers consider learning English important? Chapter 23 The Progressive Era Connections Reform Judaism By 1880 about 25,000 Jews lived in America, most were of German ancestry. Influenced by liberal Protestantism and the social gospel of reformers, many Jews began to adapt their religious customs and rituals to the American way of life. For example, they adopted a congregation structure similar to that of American Christians. Like their liberal Christian counterparts, Reform Jews supported such progressive social reforms as child-labor laws and collective bargaining. Attorney and later Supreme Court justice Louis D. Brandeis, for example, was an ardent champion of progressive causes. The Jews of the West The Metropolitan Years A poster celebrating Jewish con tributtons to America After 1880 Jewish immigrants flooded into America, many escaping persecution in Russia. Reform Jews helped these newcomers make their way in the United States. The help was given partly because of their Belief in social reform and partly because they feared these poor, old- fashioned Yiddish-speak- ing Jews would create an an ti-Jewish reac t io n among American Christians. The Russian Jews were Orthodox—observ- ing traditional Jewish beliefs and rituals. In turn, Orthodox Jews reintroduced the Reform Jews to a number of customs and rituals discarded by their parents. Making the Religion Connection 1. In what ways were Reform Jews influenced by the American way of life? 2. For what reasons did Reform Jews help Russian Jewish immigrants? Linking Past and Present 3. Flow have American Jews helped recent Russian Jewish immigrants? In calling for reform of city government, one writer complained about: [T]he mass of ignorant voters, who now help the vicious bosses to govern our cities__A colony of Italians, Scandinavians, Germans, or Irish, preserving their national language and their national ideas, and living as foreigners among us is very difficult to reach, but their votes count just as much as the votes of the most highly educated men among us. When progressives reformed government by defeating political bosses and machines, they also destroyed the system that provided immigrant groups with a political voice, political jobs, and political power. As reformers obtained child labor laws and compulsory school attendance laws, they forced immigrant children out of factories and into classrooms. Many states made the study of American history a required course in public schools during the Progressive Era. Educator John Dewey advised that it was essential to teach students to be good citizens. Immigrant groups opposed many progressive reforms. Many poor immigrants needed their children to work to aid the family income. Those from countries where drinking wine or beer was acceptable behavior objected to attempts to force temperance on them. Many immigrant women resisted the efforts of settlement-house social workers to teach them about "proper" diet, hygiene, or child care. Unit 7 Entering a New Century: 1880-19 H progressives and Race rh most conspicuous limit to progres- 1 was its attitudes about race. Like vism the rn°sr races did not *V1 ^ajority of Americans at that time, progressives believed that nonwhite were inferior. Therefore, reformers object to the segregation of nese Americans in San Francisco Lois in 19^6, nor did they oppose harp cUts *n JaPancse immigration to the United States that began in 1907. [n addition, progressives generally accepted widespread discrimination against African Americans. Although many progressives sympathized with their plight, ^0st reformers agreed with Theodore Roosevelt, who stated that blacks "as a race and in the mass are altogether inferior to the whites.' Few progressives objected to the Jim Crow laws that southern states had passed after Reconstruction to restore segregation. In 1896, when the Supreme Court ruled in Messy v. Ferguson that segregation was constitutional as long as separate facilities were equal, no progressive campaign was launched for reform. While southern whites were lynching black people and barring them from voting or holding public office, progressives were crusading for primary elections, direct election of senators, and other reforms to spread democracy. Like most whites, progressives generally accepted the South's Jim Crow system, partly due to indifference, and partly because northern blacks also were restricted to low-paying jobs, segregation, and inferior social status. These circumstances help explain a shift in black leadership during the Progressive Era. At the turn of the century the most influential black leader was Booker T. Washington. A former slave, Washington founded Alabama's Tuskegee Institute in 1881 to train African Americans in 30 trades. Washington argued that equality would be achieved not through campaigns for reform, but when blacks gained the education and skills to become valuable members of their communities. In 1895 he spelled out this view: Examining Photographs To blend immigrants into American society, settlement house social workers organized recreational activities, visited immigrants' homes, conducted homemaking and parenting classes, and worked with individual families. What attitude did progressives have about immigrant cultures? Chapter 23 The Progressive Era ... [T]he agitation ofquestions of social equality is the extremist folly... progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than of artificial forcing. No race that has anything to contribute to the markets of the world is long in any degree ostracized. Yet as the great changes in society that accompanied progressive reform largely bypassed African Americans, a new black leadership arose that rejected Washington's approach to achieving equality. The most prominent new black leader was W. E. B. Du Bois, a Harvard-educated history professor at Atlanta University. Du Bois rejected Washingtons emphasis on job skills and argued that suffrage was the way to end white supremacy, stop the lynching of blacks, and gain better schools. In 1905 Du Bois and 28 other black leaders met at Niagara Falls to demand full political rights and responsibilities for African Americans as well as an end to racial discrimination. This call eventually resulted in the founding of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. "The power of the ballot we need in sheer self-defense," he said, "else what shall save us from a second slavery?" Despite the failure of most progressives to be concerned about such questions, progressive reform helped change American society in many ways. Although they excluded large groups from their efforts, the progressives expanded democracy, reformed education, and improved the quality of life for millions of men, women, and children. Except for two amendments to the Constitution in 1919 and 1920, progressivism in America ended as the United States entered World War I. Americans turned from reforming their own society to a crusade to "make the world safe for democracy." Section Three Revi ew Summary 1 he progressives' reasons for advocat ing reform were as varied as the reforms themselves. While all progressives want ed "progress" for society, they disagreed over what that meant. For some progres sives, improving society meant limiting the political power of immigrants and eliminating customs and behaviors that reformers thought were un-American In addition, progressives generally agreed with the racial attitudes of most Americans in the early 1900s. Asian Americans and African Americans were bypassed bv progressive reform. Black leaders founded organizations such as the NAACP, however, and worked to reform society. Checking for Understanding 1.

That artificial turf must have been too slippery to |ay on." Couldn't there ^ other reasons the team lost? The statement that you heard is an example of a fallacy in a line of reasoning. Explanation A fallacy in a line of reasoning is an error in thinking something out. The fallacy may be an unsupported argument or a mistaken conclusion. In the above example, it was a fact that your team played on artificial turf. It was also a fact that your team was defeated by 20 points. But to say that it lost because the artificial turf was too slippery is a fallacy. The other team won while playing on the same turf, so there must have been other reasons your team lost. More facts are needed to explain it. To determine whether there is a fallacy in a line of reasoning, ask the following questions: • Is there any connection between the facts and the conclusion? If not, the statement contains a fallacy. If there is a connection, go on to the next question. * Is there only a loose connection between the facts and the conclusion? If there is, go on to the next question. • Are there enough facts given to reach the conclusion, or is additional information needed? If more facts are needed, the statement contains a fallacy. A group of immigrant women sew clothing by hand, Ridge Street in New York City in 1908 Example The following examples each contain a statement of fact and a conclusion. Read the statements, and note how the three steps have been applied: In the early 1900s, the managers of women workers were almost always men. This was because women lacked the ability' to direct others. (There is a loose connection between the fact that men were managers and the conclusion that women did not have the ability. But more facts are needed to support that ability was the reason. What roles did lack of educational opportunities for women and biases of male bosses play? The conclusion that women did not have management ability is not supported. The reasoning contains a fallacy.) In the late 1800s immigrants lived in the poorer sections of American cities. This indicates that they did not care about how they lived. (There is a hose connection between the fact and the concluding statement, but more information is needed to explain why immigrants lived in the poorer sections of American cities. In reality, immigrants held the least desirable low- paying jobs and often did not have the educational opportunities that would have given them the skills needed to perform the higher-paying jobs. So the claim that they did not care about how they lived is not supported.) Practice For practice in this skill, read the following sentences, and determine if a fallacy exists. If so, explain why a fallacy is present. 1. The Constitution did not contain provisions against child- labor, so the government was powerless to do anything about it. 2. The muckrakers published many books and articles, so the entire public became more aware of social injustices. 3.It was difficult to operate a democratic government and not allow women to vote, so many western states granted women full suffrage by 1914. Chapter 23 The Progressive Era Wednesdays. Citizens were also encouraged to plant "victory gardens" to raise their own vegetables. To increase wheat production, the federally financed Grain Corporation guaranteed farmers first $2.00, then $2.26 per bushel. In 1918 it bought the entire American wheat crop. The combined efforts of the Food Administration and the American public were tremendously successful. The Great War was costly beyond all expectation. By its end the United States government was spending about $44 million a day, or a total of about $33 billion. Of that amount, $10 billion went to the Allies as loans. The government raised about one-third of the money to finance the war through taxation. Income taxes were increased, although only wealthier families paid income taxes at that time. Corporations also paid higher taxes, including an "excess profits" tax, designed to return war profits to the government. The government also levied excise duties on items as varied as theater tickets, chewing gum, and phonograph records. The government borrowed the rest of the money—more than $20 billion— from the American people by selling four issues of Liberty Bonds and a postwar issue of Victory Bonds. Posters, rallies, and "Liberty Loan sermons" encouraged Examining Photographs With American and British flags flying, this huge rally was one of many held to encourage Americans to support the war by purchasing war bonds.

Examining Illustrations The controls that characterized progressive reform were applied to the war effort. How did government increase food supplies? people to buy the bonds. Purchasing bonds became an act of patriotism. Even children were urged to use their pennies to buy War Savings Stamps. Boy Scouts sold the stamps under the slogan "Even' Scout to Save a Soldier." Twenty-one million people—more than one-fifth of the nations population—subscribed to the Fourth Liberty Loan. Controlling Public Opinion Because the success of the war effort depended heavily on voluntary civilian cooperation, the government wanted to make sure that Americans understood and supported the nation's war aims. It established the Committee on Public Information under the leadership of journalist and author George Creel to "sell" the war to America. Creel described his job as the world's greatest adventure in advertising. He recruited advertising people, commercial artists, authors, songwriters, entertainers, public speakers, and motion-picWre Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-193- • c m help him.

Loyalty Leagues- organized by Creel, encouraged Americans to spy on their neighbors and to report those who might be "disloyal." Thousands of people were imprisoned, sometimes for opinions expressed in private conversations. People were arrested for criticizing the President, for questioning the American form of government, for criticizing the army or even military uniforms. Socialist leader Eugene Debs was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison for merely telling an audience to "resist militarism, wherever found." People were even jailed for criticizing the Red Cross and the YMCA. Although war fever was responsible for the vigorous enforcement of these laws, the courts generally upheld the principle behind them. During the war about 2,000 cases involving convictions under the Espionage and Sedition acts were heard on appeal in federal courts. After the war, some of these cases reached the Supreme Court. In the landmark case Schenck v. United States (1919), Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., writing for a unanimous Court, stated: were distributed explaining the When a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as [soldiers] fight and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right__________ The Court refused, however, to support punishment when no "clear and present danger" of hurting the United States existed or when the accused was jailed for unpopular political beliefs. War fever was also to blame for the mistreatment and persecution of German Americans. Despite Wilsons insistence that Americans were "the sincere friends of the German people," anti-German sentiment ran high. Many school systems banned the teaching of the German language, and orchestras stopped performing the music of Beethoven, Schubert, and Wagner. George M. Cohan 1878-1942 By the time he wrote "Over There"—the most popular song of World War I—George M. Cohan was already a star. At the age of 14, he was creating songs and skits for his family's vaudeville act. By his early 20s, he was writing, producing, and starring in hit Broadway shows. Claiming that he had been born on the 4th of July (actually July 3), Cohan discovered early in his career that he could excite crowds with such patriotic appeals as his "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy." When American troops left for France in 1917, he quickly penned "Over There," touching the chord of nationalistic fervor sweeping the country. His song became America's war anthem. In 1940 Congress awarded Cohan a Medal of Honor for "Over There" and "You're a Grand Old Flag," another patriotic song. Chapter 25 World War I Examining Photographs This scene showing alleged German military brutality is from "Hearts of the World" by America's best known silent filmmaker, D. W. Griffith. It was part of a government effort to shape public opinion about the war. What government agency was responsible for the propaganda campaign? Sauerkraut was renamed "Liberty cabbage," hamburgers were "Liberty sausage," and German measles became "Liberty measles." While the war was foremost in the President's mind, Wilson never ceased to think ahead to the peace that would follow. In January 1918, Wilson went before Congress to present his goals and objectives for a lasting peace. With his Fourteen Points (see Appendix), the President hoped to establish a new world order. The Fourteen Points were based on "the principle of justice to all peoples and nationalities." The President proposed to eliminate the general causes of war through disarmament, freedom of the seas, and open diplomacy instead of secret agreements. Wilson also addressed the right of peoples to live under a government of their own choosing. Finally, he proposed an international peacekeeping organization. Although Wilsons words appealed to a world weary of war, the other Allied leaders were not particularly supportive of the Fourteen Points. They had designs on German territory and a desire to see Germany punished for starting the war. A formidable challenge lay ahead for President Wilson if he were to see his dream of a lasting peace realized. Summary The war drastically changed life in America. Besides the cost in lives, the was a financial drain, financed by *** increased taxation and borrowing The government took control of the nation's economy, waged a propaganda campaign to instill public support for the war, and passed laws to suppress opposition to the war effort.

Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932 Linking Across Time Suppressing Dissent In 1780 Seagoe Potter, a British Loyalist, was tried and convicted 0f treason in a court in Delaware, for his dissent against the Ameri- caJ1 Revolution the jury sentenced Potter to be tortured and hanged. A nation that had been founded on the fundamental right to disagree was itself stifling dissent. Although the American government no longer brutalizes dissenters, it has often suppressed those who disagree with its actions or policies, particularly during wartime. Seagoe Potter was not the only colonist to remain loyal to Britain during the Revolution. Perhaps one-third of the population retained their ties to King George and Parlia- ment-—some openly, some secretly. Although about 80,000 Loyalists emigrated, as many as 400,000 remained in America. Some Loyalists actively aided British armies. To the revolutionaries, their presence and opposition constituted a danger to the security of the nation. Loyalists were denounced in the press, reviled in the streets, tarred and feathered in barnyards, and sometimes, like Potter, tortured and hanged. During the Civil War, dissenters who opposed Abraham Lincoln's attempt to force the South back into the Union resisted the draft system. Union troops forcefully suppressed rioting dissenters in New York City' and an uprising in the coal-mining region of Pennsylvania. Others supported the war but opposed the methods Lincoln used to wage it, particularly his suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. The Emancipation Proclamation, which for modern Americans defines the moral purpose of the war, caused widespread dissent at the time it was issued. Many officers of volunteer regiments protested by resigning, and thousands of enlisted men deserted. Junior Red Cross parading for patriotism, St. Paul, Minnesota During World War I, President Wilson called for all citizens who opposed the war to be silenced. German Americans were perceived to be treasonous dissenters simply' because of their nationality. They were spied on by their neighbors, coerced into buying war bonds, and forbidden to speak German in public or on the telephone. The campaign of suppression was almost totally baseless. German Americans, about 8 percent of the population, were overwhelmingly loyal to the United States. There was loud antiwar dissent before the United States entered World War II. But after Japan bornbed Pearl Harbor, Americans united behind the war effort. This the target of suspicion. As with German Americans in World War I, the threat was perceived rather than real. However, most Japanese Americans lost their businesses and homes and were detained in "internment camps," for most of the war. Dissenters during the Vietnam war questioned the morality of involvement in another country's fight for democracy instead of using American resources to fight poverty' and civil rights violations at home. The government used the courts, the FBI, and even the Internal Revenue Service to investigate and harass leading dissenters. But as antiwar rallies grew to hundreds of thousands of people, public opinion increasingly influenced American withdrawal from that conflict. Although some dissent arose after American forces were sent to the Persian Gulf to fight Iraq in 1991, antiwar protests were countered by rallies of equal size in support of the war.

Chafier 25 World War I Connections Changing the Map of Europe Part of President Wilsons peace program following World War I called for self-determination of nations. Before the war Europe was a complex mosaic, or pattern, of distinct ethnic groups. Many of these groups lived within the borders of nations dominated by other ethnic Wilson with Allied leaders at Versailles groups. Wilson believed that national boundaries should be drawn to give each ethnic population its own nation. Other powers at the Versailles Peace Conference, however, had their own plans. Allied leaders wanted to weaken the Central Powers by dividing their land. Some Allies also wanted their enemies' territory for themselves. Wilson's secretary of state, Robert Lansing, noted that the boundaries created after the war were artificial and did not follow ethnic population patterns. Lansing stated that they would last only as long as dissatisfied nations were too weak to change them. He believed that when one nation became confident of its strength and began to seek to remedy these boundaries, a new' war would take place. Twenty years later that became the case. Connection 1 • How did WilSon think national boundaries should be determined in Europe after World War I? Linking Past And Present 2. How did the desire for autonomy among ethnic groups affect die Soviet Union in the 1990s? With the President silenced, in November 1919, and again in March 1920, the Senate refused to ratify the Versailles Treaty. Instead, the United States negotiated a separate peace treaty with each of the Central Powers in 1921. Americas Postwar Problems The fate of the treaty was only one of a number of problems the United States faced in the years after World War I. Demobilizing the armed forces, returning to a peacetime economy, and coping with fears of espionage presented the country with serious challenges. The United States began to demobilize as soon as the hostilities ended. Within a short time, the army was reduced to less than 500,000, and economic controls were lifted. The businesspeople left Washington, and industry converted to peacetime production. With Wilson preoccupied with the peace treaty and later incapacitated, the nation received little overall direction. Industry enjoyed a brief postwar boom, resulting from the increased demand for consumer goods that had been scarce during the war. But government spending during the war brought inflation that nearly doubled the cost of living by 1919, and prices rose to a point where many consumers could not afford to pay for new items. Consequently, after 1920 business activity slowed. Farmers were especially hard-hit. The slackening of wartime demands for food and the end of government price guarantees caused agricultural prices to plummet. Many farmers who took advantage of high wartime crop prices and went into debt to expand their farms now faced bankruptcy. Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-193- f High prices also contributed to labor nrest after the war, and when the War i , r Board disbanded, the truce veen employers and organized labor ded- A record number—3600—strikes Recurred in 1919, most meeting with lit- success. But 4 of them—the Seattle general Strike, the Boston Police Strike, stee] strike, and the coal strike—were hiehlv disruptive and had effects that lasted well into the 1920s. In January 1919, only 2 months after armistice, 35,000 shipyard workers from Seattle, Washington, went on strike for a 10 percent increase in their wages. The next month union workers in all Seattle industries walked off their j0bs in support of the shipyard strikers. Many city residents viewed the strike as revolutionary. They responded by hoarding food and fuel and by purchasing guns. Seattle's mayor blamed the situation on dangerous radicals and after 5 days used the state militia to break the strike. In September 1919, another major city was hit by labor unrest as Boston's police force went on strike for better wages and working conditions. Looters soon were in the streets, smashing windows and stealing goods. When the mayor was unable to restore order, Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge called out the state guard. A new police force was hired, and Coolidge received national acclaim for his view that "There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, anytime." Later that month more than 350,000 steelworkers went on strike across 10 states, demanding better wages, an 8-hour rather than a 12-hour day, and the right to join a union. Two-thirds of the strikers were immigrants. Most of the office workers and supervisors, who refused to join the strike, were American-born. The steel companies blamed the strike on labor radicals who told "these foreigners... that if they would join the union they would get Americans' jobs. When the companies hired replacement workers, violence broke out, and federal troops were called in to protect them. After 4 months, the strikers gave up with no gains. While the steel strike was underway, 450,000 coal miners walked off their jobs nationwide. Overworked and underpaid, the strikers demanded a 60 percent pay increase and a 30-hour week. Since at the time coal was the nation's major energy source, the government responded quickly. Obtaining a court order, it forced the strikers back to work. Eventually, however, coal miners won a 31-percent pay increase to $7.50 a day. Many Americans had long suspected a link between labor unrest and political radicalism. The strikes of 1919 helped fuel a larger "Red Scare" than the United States experienced after the war. When the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in 1917, they called on workers everywhere to revolt. In 1919 communism seemed to have great appeal among the poverty-stricken peoples of wartorn Europe. Although the overwhelming majority of American labor leaders were not allied with the communists, nervertheless, many Americans suspected them of planning revolution. Examining Photographs Chicago's African- American population grew from 44,000 in 1910 to 109,000 by 1920. Racial conflict in 1919 devastated this South Side neighborhood. Why did whites resent the presence of blacks in northern cities after the war? Chapter 25 World War I The same laws used to quiet opposition and suppress civil liberties during the war were now turned against radicals. Immi- grants—especially those with Russian names—came under suspicion. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer rounded up 6,000 immigrants that the government suspected of being communists and deported—expelled from the country— nearly 600 of them. Some of the immigrants deported had become American citizens, and some were deported without trials. Accompanying the Red Scare was a wave of racism. Racial tensions rose as white soldiers returning from Europe found themselves competing for jobs and housing with blacks who had come north during the war. During the summer of 1919, race riots broke out in many northern cities. The worst of these was in Chicago, where nearly 40 people were killed and more than 500 injured. One journalist described the scene: Examining Maps Before the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, half the states had granted full or partial women's suffrage. But state laws could change, so suffragists continued to push for an amendment. What effect did the war have on the movement? During this wild week mobs of whites pursued and beat and killed [blacks]. Other mobs of [blacks] pursued and beat and killed whites Armed bands in motor trucks dashed wildly up and down the streets, firing into houses—if rain had not come, it is doubtful if the armed forces could have stemmed the emotional tide that was inflaming Chicago's citizens. Few cities in the United States escaped racial violence in the early 1920s. Even after the Red Scare died down, racial intolerance lived on in organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, which spread from the South to become a powerful national force during the decade. Wilson's Legacy Despite a lack of presidential leadership as Wilsons second term drew to a close, Congress and the states implemented important laws. In 1920 Congress passed the Esch-Cummins Act, which turned the operation of railroads back to their owners. This statute gave the Interstate Commerce Commission almost complete power to fix rates as well as to regulate railroad financing, but the commission was now less concerned with restraining railroad companies as it was with helping them. World War I helped to add two amendments to the Constitution-—both the culmination of century-old reform movements. Prohibition, which had made great gains before the war, made even greater advances during the war. "Hooverizing" put the country in the mood to sacrifice, and war needs compelled the government to forbid the use of grain to manufacture liquor. By January 1919, two-thirds of the states had ratified the Eighteenth Amendment, Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932 hibinng "the manufacture, sale, or ^Asportation" of intoxicating beverages. 1 Xhe war also advanced the cause of ^men's rights. It was difficult to deny Jernands that women be allowed to vote fter they had performed traditionally [Hale jobs in factories and fields and served with courage and devotion behind the lines in Europe. On the eve 0f the 1920 presidential election, after decades of struggle, women gained suffrage when the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified.^ Wilson's final year and a half in office left the country virtually leaderless. The President had recovered sufficiently to transact routine business. But his attention and energies still were focused on getting the United States into the League of Nations. Retaining a belief that the American people would not retreat from world leadership, he urged that the election of 1920 be a "great and solemn referendum" on the League issue. But the 1920 election saw Wilson's party and the League repudiated at the polls. The country wanted to turn its back to world responsibilities. In 1923, shortly before he died, Wilson warned: I can predict with absolute certainty that within another generation there will be another world war if the nations of the world do not concert the method by which to prevent it. Few people listened to Wilson's warning, however. Most Americans wanted to put their memories of war, suffering, and sacrifice behind them. The return of prosperity by 1923 caused Americans to view the future with optimism and confidence. The *ar to end all wars was over. The United States had done its part in making the world "safe for democracy." Americans turned their backs on Europe. It was time to start enjoying the peace. Chapter 25 World War I Section Four Review Summary Wilson's chances to achieve peace on his terms were damaged when he snubbed his Republican opposition and spent too much time in Europe. His attempts to write many of his Fourteen Points into the peace treaty were thwarted by France and Great Britain who were more interested in repayment and revenge. Although some of Wilson's points.were accepted in altered forms, the treaty faced opposition at home. In response, Wilson toured the United States promoting the treaty until his health failed. In addition, the nation's peacetime economy was hampered by a rising cost of living, labor unrest, and lower crop prices. Yet reform continued as Prohibition and women's suffrage were enacted by amendments to the Constitution. Checking for Understanding 1.

How did the Senate's rejection of the Treaty of Versailles reflect changing American attitudes about participation in world affairs? Linking Across Time Today's Immigrant Issues As in the 1920s, some Americans today resent recent immigrants. In California, where the percentage of Hispanic Americans is 3 times larger than anywhere else in the country, some resentment is caused by the misguided belief that Hispanics refuse to learn to speak English. A recent study showed, however, that 90 percent of Hispanic children do speak English and that 25 percent of the children speak no Spanish at all. jobs elsewhere, the transition was sometimes difficult. Not only were they often forced to leave home to find employment, but they also frequently lost the benefit of long years spent learning a particular skill. The introduction of juke boxes and sound films, to cite an extreme example, caused widespread unemployment among musicians. And although the assembly line lowered the costs of production, many laborers could not stand the monotony and nervous tension caused by working at a speed set by the machine. This was particularly true of middle-aged workers, for whom "old at 40" became a bitter slogan. The "prosperity decade" saw labor unions decline in number and strength. Even the American Federation of Labor, one of the largest workers' organizations, had difficulty holding its members in the face of the antiunion activities of employers' associations. Employers joined to promote the open shop—or a shop where workers did not have to join a union. Labeled the "American Plan," in practice the open shop meant a shop closed to union members. To further reduce the power of unions, companies promoted welfare capitalism, a system to make employees feel more a part of the business by enabling them to buy shares of stock, by instituting profitsharing, and by providing such fringe benefits as medical care, retirement pensions, and recreational facilities. Moreover, wages and working conditions improved somewhat for many during the 1920s. With some improvement in their standards of living and the relative weakness of unions, striking seemed pointless to many workers. Although Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce, persuaded President Harding to make a successful personal appeal to the leaders of the steel industry to abandon the 12-hour day, the federal government was usually on the side of the employers. Thus Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty helped to break railroad and coal strikes in 1922 by obtaining injunctions that prohibited every conceivable union activity, including picketing, making public statements to the press, and jeering at strikebreakers. In 1919 the Indiana State Guard—and eventually federal troops—protected strikeb^i.. 1 United States Steel. In addition ^ Supreme Court continually whittled' at the protections that unions th they had secured by the Clayton Act^' 1914. Once again, injunctions were f | used to stop strikes and boycotts. Restricting Immigration In the decade before World War I approximately 1 million persons a year came to live in the United States, ove two-thirds of these from countries ln southern and eastern Europe, such as Italy, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Greece. Living standards in those countries were low and educational opportunities limited. To slow down this tide of immigration, Congress passed in 1917 an act requiring a literacy test, designed to exclude large numbers of immigrants. The act, however, had little effect. New immigrants congregated in such cities as New York and Chicago, where opportunities for employment were greatest. Here immigrants formed homogenous ethnic communities—every major city had its own "Little Italy," "Little Poland," "Little Greece," and so forth. But this in turn gave rise to the charge that the new immigrants resisted "Americanization." Established immigrants resented the new immigrants' increasing political power. Even more, they feared that the newcomers, most of whom were Catholic, would overthrow traditional Protestant values. Conservative labor unions were angered by the willingness of poor immigrants to work for very low wages. Employers, who had previously favored unrestricted immigration as a means of hiring cheap labor, now came to fear that the new immigrants were radicals who would fight fora communist revolution. During and after World War I, Feeling against "hyphenated-Americans" was stimulated by anti-German hysteria, ty the "Red scare," and by the sinister Ku Klux Klan. When immigrants began to pour into the United States, fleeing that war-torn countries in the hopes of findiiffl a mythical land of wealth and opportunity, Congress took quick action. In 1921 Unit 8 Conflict, Confidence, and Collapse: 1914-1932 Kiding signed the Emergency Quota f Aft, W^'C^ severe*L cut r^e number of pie admitted to the United States. According to this act, only 3 percent of l£ total number of people in any nation- group already living in the United States in 1910 would be admitted during a single year. Three years later the National Origins Act made restriction a permanent policy. This 1924 law temporarily reduced the quota still further, setting it at 2 percent of those residing in this country in 1890. It also provided that after 1927 a total of only 150,000 immigrants would be admitted to the United States per year, their nationalities apportioned on the basis of the 1920 census. This meant that more than 85 percent of the new immigrants would be from northern and western Europe—mainly from Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia. The intention of the National Origins Act was clearly to discriminate against certain nationalities and races. This became even more apparent when immigrants from Asia and Africa were assigned either very small quotas or barred entirely. In fact, Japanese immigration was completely Examining Photographs Members of the Ku Klux Klan parade down Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.

An event that for many came to sym bolize mistrust of immigrants in the United States was the trial of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. These two Italian immigrants and anarchists were accused in 1921 of killing two men during a robbery in Massachusetts. They were convicted. but many thought they never received a fair trial. It was believed that the trial judge was prejudiced against the defendants because of their ethnic backgrounds and political beliefs. For years attempts were made to obtain a retrial, but in 1927 Sacco and Vanzetti were executed. In his final statement in court, Vanzetti continued to maintain his innocence of the crime, saying: Section One Review [Mb' c°nviction 15 c^at 1 ^ave suffere<*for f ' thing5 that I am guilty of.

Scandals Among Harding's Advisers Although President Harding was personally honest, there was more corruption in his administration than in any previous one. Hardings poker-playing friends, known as "the Ohio Gang," used their ties to the President and the attorney general to sell government appointments, pardons, and immunity from prosecution. Harding's choice for head of the Veterans' Bureau, for example, arranged fraudulent contracts that sold supplies from veterans' hospitals at a cost to the taxpayers of about $200 million. The worst scandal, however, involved Harding's secretary of the interior, Albert B. Fall, who secretly leased to private interests oil lands, which had been set aside for the navy, at Teapot Dome, Wyoming, and Elk Hills, California. In return, Fall received bribes totaling more than $300,000. Eventually the Senate investigated the Teapot Dome scandal, and Secretary Fall went to prison. When Harding learned what was going on, he complained privately that he had been betrayed. He said that he had no troubles with his enemies, but his friends—they were a different story: "They're the ones that keep me walking the floor nights!" In the summer of 1923, Harding traveled to Alaska, deeply concerned and depressed over the scandals in his administration. On his return from Alaska, Harding became severely ill with what may have been food poisoning, pneumonia, or a heart attack. He died on August 2, shortly before news the scandals broke to the public. Summary President Harding's easy, comfortable style matched America's mood in 1920. In an attempt to maintain world peace and order, the Harding administration negotiated the Allies' war debts and concluded the Washington Conference treaties. But Harding's administration was marred by scandal. Business returned to prewar conditions, but the nation reacted to the war by restricting immigration and by discriminating against racial and ethnic minorities. Checking for Understanding 1.

Chapter 26 Decade of Normalcy Map and Graph Skills Interpreting Graphic Data "A picture is worth a thousand words." How many times have you heard that expression? Often it is true. A political cartoonist, for example, can reduce a wordy newspaper column into a clever illustration that says the same thing in a more concise and interesting way. Another way to present information pictorially is in the form of a graph. Explanation When historical information involves numbers and statistics, it is often presented as a graph. Graphs frequently have an advantage over printed text because they make organizing and comparing detailed or complex information much easier. Graphic data can be presented in the form of circle graphs, bar graphs, or line graphs. All three forms organize and show information visually rather than verbally. That is why graphs, just like political cartoons, catch your eye and hold your attention. Use the following guidelines to interpret data presented as a graph: a. What is the purpose of the graph? How does the data it presents relate to any printed material that accompanies it? b. What does each part of the graph represent? What does each color, line, or bar represent? Are there labels? If two or more graphs are shown, observe the labels for each. c. What significant changes or other relationships does the graph show? What generalizations can be made about these changes or relationships? Example The circle graphs on this page provide immigration data. Apply the guidelines to interpret the data shown on them. a.What is the purpose of this graph? • Each graph compares the geographic distribution of immigrants who came to the United States during three different years. Related written material in the chapter notes anti-immi- grant sentiments in the 1920s. It also details a change in immigration policy after 1927 to restrict Asian immigrants and those from eastern and southern Europe. b.What does each part of the graph represent? • Each colored section on these graphs shows the percentage of immigrants who came to the Uni",d .fTM"> > area of the world in 1921 iciT and 1930. c.What significant changes 0 other relationships does ,1/ graph show? • The proportion of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe was reduced from 4i percent in 1921 to only 4 percent in 1925, while at the same time Latin American immigration increased from 15 percent to 48 percent. The percentage of immigrants from northern, western, and central Europe remained fairly constant throughout the 1920s. Practice For further practice, apply me guidelines to the bar graph on page 767 showing additional data about immigration.

The man who works there worships there. ^Calvin Coolidge Speech to the American Society ofNewspaper Editors, January 1925 Section Focus When awakened to hear that Harding's death had made him President, Vice President Coolidge was off at his boyhood home in Vermont. His father, a justice of the peace, administered the oath of office in the flickering light of a kerosene lamp. This homey scene typified the small-town values of the new President—values he would come to depend on throughout the course of his presidency, and which many Americans still shared. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Discuss the changes to industry Henry Ford introduced. • Outline the problems of farmers during the 1920s and the government's response to them. • Describe the purpose of the Kellogg- Briand Pact. Coolidge had many of the traits often associated with rural small-town America. He was intensely conservative, cautious, in4 given to few words. In occasional Public speeches and magazine articles, he preached the old-fashioned virtues of honesty, thrift, and hard work. His philosophy of government was simple: economy and laissez-faire. To take as little action as possible was with Coolidge almost a principle of life; he once said, "Four-fifths of all our troubles in this life would disappear if we would only sit down and keep still." As President, Coolidge was reputed to sleep 10 hours every night and take a nap every afternoon. By 1924 the scandals of the Harding administration had surfaced, thus presenting the Democratic party with a ready- made issue for the presidential campaign. But the Democrats threw away their chances for victory at their national convention. The party was deeply divided over two issues: Prohibition—which the rural regions favored and the cities opposed—and more importantly, the Ku Klux Klan. This secret society, which took its name and ritual from the southern organization of Reconstruction times, resembled the Know-Nothings of the 1850s in that it was designed to intimidate African Americans, Catholics, Jews, immigrants, and "foreign ideas" such as the League of Nations. By the mid-1920s the Klan had become a major force in politics, despite its willingness to use terror and violence to carry out its goals. At the 1924 Democratic convention, the rivals for the nomination were William G. McAdoo of California—who favored Prohibition and was generally supported by the West and South—and Governor Alfred E. Smith of New York—a Roman Catholic and opponent of Prohibition whose following came mostly from urban areas of the Northeast. Smith's supporters wanted an outright condemnation of the Ku Klux Klan, which southern and western delegates blocked. The two candidates were deadlocked for so long that the cow- boy-humorist Will Rogers suggested that the eventual nominee might be born at the convention. By the time a compromise candidate—John W. Davis of West Vir- ginia—was nominated on the one-hun- dred-and-third ballot, the Democrats had lost all chance of winning the election. The Republicans campaigned on the slogan "Keep cool with Coolidge"; the Chapter 26 Decade of Normalcy Last year my wife.. .got herself a job with the government and she's making 21 dollars a month, working at the sewing room. This just about takes care of everything. The New Deal and Minorities As the poorest of the poor, blacks often fell through the cracks of broad legislation such as the AAA and the Social Security Act. For example, although the AAA gave money to rural landowners, in the South 80 percent of all black farmers owned no land. In addition, Roosevelt offered no civil rights program and did little to challenge the segregation that continue to exist throughout the nation, and he t^[ erated job discrimination. Even r a some government agencies, such as the TVA refused to hire African Americans. Th ' that did, such as the CCC and armed forces, segregated black and white work ers. In addition, African Americans received lower wages than white workers and were not assigned to certain jobs. Nevertheless, Roosevelt appointed more African Americans to government posts than any President before him. Although most black officials filled secondary posts they influenced the President as an unofficial "black cabinet." Heading the black cabinet was Mary McLeod Bethune director of the Negro Affairs Division of the National Youth Administration. A personal friend of Eleanor Roosevelt, she often expressed the black cabinet's concerns to the First Lady, who then carried them to FDR. Examining Photographs Most blacks did not directly benefit from the New Deal. Although African Americans in the North contributed heavily to Roosevelt's election victories, he did not protest the poll taxes in the South that prevented poor blacks and whites from voting. What explanations are there for his stand? Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960 Qnc concern of blacks in and out of 0vernment during the Depression was an increase in lynching and other acts of mob violence against African Americans. One iece of civil rights legislation that Roosevelt did support was a 1934 federal antilynching bill that held local sheriffs accountable for the frequent lynchings of blacks in the South. But he never made the bill a legislative priority, so it never reached the House floor and it finally died in the Senate in 1938. One reason New Deal programs for African Americans were so limited was the opposition of powerful congressional committee heads who were from the South. So Roosevelt accepted NRA codes, for example, that permitted a lower minimum wage in the South than in the rest of the nation. FDR felt that if he pushed these southern legislators too strongly, he would lose their support. In general, the federal government responded more favorably to white ethnic groups.

The film was a big hit because people got 4 hours of escapist entertainment for just 10 cents. What other mass entertainment media was popular in the 1930s? series called "Americans All...Immigrants All." The show celebrated the cultural vitality of a democracy made up of people from many lands. It also indicated the Democrats' awareness of the political power that ethnic groups could exercise if they were organized. Immigrants and their children made up 40 percent of the white population at that time. They tended to vote in groups and could swing elections, especially in large urban areas. Americans of Irish, Italian, and Polish descent became major partners in the New Deal coalition. Because of the Depression, however, immigration declined in the 1930s. In fact, more people emigrated from the United States during the 1930s than immigrated to it. Popular Culture The 1930s were somber years compared to the fads and frivolity of the 1920s. Literature and the arts generally turned to more realistic themes about poverty and human suffering. Grim times provided powerful themes for American authors such as John Dos Passos, whose trilogy of novels called U.S.A. focused on fictional characters who lost their ideals Chapter 28 The New Deal Examining Photographs World War II offered increased job opportunities for women and for African Americans. The number of women who worked jumped from 27 percent to 37 percent. Although women's wages rose, they still averaged 60 percent less than men's wages. What happened to women's jobs when the war ended? in government offices and in companies that had war contracts. But while it opposed discrimination, the commission did not reject segregation. Even the military remained segregated, and although hundreds of thousands of African Americans served in uniform, in every capacity from cooks to fighter pilots, most served in all-black units. The most significant racial discrimination of the war involved the removal of Japanese Americans from the West Coast. About 90 percent of all Japanese Americans, outside Hawaii, lived in California and the Pacific Northwest. Because of immigration restrictions after 1924, two- thirds had been born in the United States and were citizens by birth. Yet government officials were suspicious of their loyalty. When war broke out, residents of California, Oregon, and Washington feared that with the Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor severely damaged, they were vulnerable to invasion at any time. Californians, in particular, were concerned that their neighbors of Japanese descent might engage in sabotage. Army General John DeWitt investigated and reported that: The Japanese race is an enemy race and while many second and third generation Japanese born on United States soil have become "Americanized, " the racial strains are undiluted....It, therefore, follows that along the vital Pacific Coast over 112,000 potential enemies of Japanese extraction are at large today. Based on such reports, beginning in February 1942, the government moved 120,000 Japanese Americans to detention centers surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by soldiers and confined them there for the duration of the war. The order to evacuate Japanese Americans from the West Coast came quickly. Detainees had as little as 48 hours to make arrangements for their homes, businesses, and farms. Many had to sell their property at a loss or abandon it. Bargain hunters descended on them, taking advantage of their plight. Unit 9 Times of Crisis: 1932-1960 Examining Photographs Black soldiers were assigned greater combat roles than they were given during World War I. Why is this anti-aircraft gun crew entirely African American? Arriving at one of 10 detention camps in isolated areas of Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, and other sparsely settled western states, they were put to work at menial low-paying jobs. Their military guards searched their quarters for "weapons," sometimes confiscating kitchen knives, scissors, and even knitting needles. Entire families lived out the war in a single room in army-style barracks furnished with cots and bare light bulbs. Since the authorities had no plans for running the camps, the detainees established their own camp governments, schools, and newspapers. Almost immediately detainees appealed to the courts to protect their civil liberties. When the issue finally came before the Supreme Court in December 1944, in Examining Photographs Seattle residents look on as a group of the city's Japanese American population, under army escort, are put on trains to be shipped to camps for detention during the war. How did the Supreme Court rule on this action? Chapter 29 World War II Korematsu v. United States, the justices upheld the government's policy as necessary for national security. Despite their unhappy experience, most Japanese Americans remained loyal to the United States. More than 8,000 were drafted, and more than 9,000 others volunteered for military service. AJapanese- American army unit recruited from detention camps fought in the Italian campaign and was the army's most decorated unit during the war. However, the government's policy toward Japanese Americans at home became a blot on the nation's war record. Charles Drew 1904-1950 Born and raised in the segregated city of Washington, D.C., Charles Drew refused to let racial prejudice bar him from professional success. After graduating from Amherst College in Massachusetts, he earned his M.D. degree at Canada's McGill University. In the 1930s Drew conducted pioneering research on blood plasma, and he established a model blood plasma bank. When the United States entered World War II, Drew was asked to head the military's blood plasma program. By collecting, storing, transporting, and transfusing donated blood plasma, this program saved the lives of countless wounded soldiers. But in 1942 Drew resigned when the military refused to accept blood donations from African Americans unless their blood was segregated from the blood of white donors and was given only to black soldiers. Summary Although the cost was suffering, brma| devastation, and tragic loss of life abroad World War II accomplished on the home front what the New Deal failed to achieve—an end to the Depression. Demand for war goods created new industries and stimulated existing business. Under orders from the War Production Board, many industrial plants converted to war production. The government responded to inflation with price ceilings, and to scarcity with rationing of specific consumer goods. Wartime productivity increased employment, wages, and opportunity for all workers, including .African Americans and women. Japanese Americans, however, were gathered and detained for the duration of the war. Checking for Understanding 1. Identify War Production Board 2. Define wildcat strikes 3.

When he reached draft age, Ota was required to register for military service. He served in an armored division of the U.S. Army. In the following passage, Ota reflects on the effects of his internment on himself and his children. From Studs Terkel, "The Good War," An Oral History of World War Two: We came back to Los Angeles at the end of the war, believing that there was no other way but to be American. We were discouraged with our Japanese culture. My feeling at the time was, I had to prove myself. I don't know why I had to prove myself. Here I am, an ex-GI, born and raised here. Why do I have to prove myself We all had this feeling. We had to prove that we were Americans, okay? My mother and father sent me to a Japanese school teaching the culture. My wife and I did nothing with our children in that respect. We moved to a white community near Los Angeles. It was typical American suburb living. We became more American than Americans, very conservative. My wife and I, we talk about this. We thought this Japanese Americans waiting for registration at the Santa Anita Reception Center, Los Angeles County, California was the thing we had to do; to blend into the community and become part of white America. My children were denied a lot of the history of what happened. If you think of all those forty years of silence, I think this stems from another Japanese characteristic: when shame is put on you, you try to hide it. We were put into camp, we became victims, it was our fault. We hide it. My oldest daughter, Cathy, in her senior year at college, wanted to write a thesis about the camp experience. She asked if we knew people she might interview. Strange thing is, many people, even now, didn't want to talk about it. Some of the people she did talk to broke down. Because this was the first time they had told this story. This is the same thing I did. When / first went into detail, it just broke me up. When it came out, I personally felt good about it. It was somethin' that was inside of me that I've wanted to say for a long time. Examining the Primary Source 1. What effect did Ota's wartime experiences have on his feelings about Japanese culture? 2. How does Ota explain the long silence of Japanese Americans on the internment camps? Thinking Critically 3. Compare Ota's upbringing with that of his children. Suggest reasons for the differences that you identify. 4. What, in your opinion, may have prompted Ota's daughter to write about the camp experience? 5. Was the United States' domestic policy of interning Japanese Americans inconsistent with its opposition to Hitler's racial policies? Explain your answer. Chapter 29 World War II young and old, black and white. Known as "the Great Society," Johnsons domestic program was an effort to expand upon Kennedy's ideas as well as to make a contribution of his own. It was designed to fight poverty, discrimination, unemployment, pollution, and other social ills of America. At the same time, he pledged to provide major tax cuts for individuals and corporations. He also promised not to expand the war in Vietnam. To offer voters "a choice, not an echo," Republicans selected an outspoken conservative, Barry Goldwater, to run against Johnson and his liberal running mate, Hubert Humphrey. The Arizona senator Cesar Chavez 1927- Born to Mexican-American migrant workers, Cesar Chavez picked crops in the Southwest as a child and young man. At age 25, he began organizing farm workers to win better pay and working conditions. Early in the 1960s, Chavez founded a union for migrant farm workers and later merged it with another to form the first large-scale organization of farm workers. He then led a strike against grape growers. The strike drew national attention as Chavez borrowed tactics from the civil rights movement—marches and a 25-day fast. Yet the growers would not settle. The tide began to turn in 1968 when Chavez asked Americans to boycott grapes. Growers' profits tumbled as consumers sided with the workers. The strike lasted until 1970, when the growers finally agreed to settle. ran a determined, uncompromising cain paign. His opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 turned away black voters His coolness to Social Security made older people fearful. His support of the open shop hurt him with organized labor Above all, Goldwater's suggestion that military commanders should be allowed to decide for themselves whether or not to use nuclear weapons made many people nervous. As predicted, Johnsons wide appeal won him more than 60 percent of the popular vote. Goldwater carried only his home state of Arizona and 5 southern states, where former "Dixiecrats" switched to the Republican party. The Great Society had won an overwhelming mandate. War on Poverty In the mid-1960s the United States had the highest standard of living in the world. But behind the Great Society program was a new awareness that many Americans did not share in the general prosperity. Contributing to this awareness was a book by Michael Harrington entitled The Other America, published in 1962. In response to economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who wrote in The Affluent Society that only "pockets" of poverty remained, Harrington claimed that as many as 40 million Americans— one-fourth of the population—were poor. He charged: The United States contains an underdeveloped nation, a culture poverty. Its inhabitants do not suffer the extreme poverty of the peasants of Asia.. .yet the mechanism of the misery is similar. They are beyond history, beyond progress, sunk in a paralyzing, maiming routine. The public knew little of the great mass of human misery, said Harrington. The poor were hidden away in the slums of Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present ryw*i :VW& Examining Photographs The War on Poverty reached into Appalachia where poor soil and lack of education affected many lives. Why was Project Head Start established? central cities, in rural areas—especially in Appalachia and the deep South—and on Indian reservations. Many of the poor were elderly people leading "lives of quiet desperation" in secluded rooms. It was not possible for these people to "pull themselves up by their bootstraps," Harrington believed. Automation had done away with the jobs of many workers, and small farmers could no longer compete with agribusiness. Further, pensions and Social Security did not adequately cover medical expenses for older citizens. Johnson announced his strategy in his first State of the Union Address on January 8, 1964: "This administration... declares unconditional war on poverty in America." A new Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) aimed its billion- dollar budget at illiteracy, unemployment, and disease. The OEO-sponsored VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) sent workers to improve conditions in poor neighborhoods. Job Corps provided training for the unskilled; Project Head Start helped poor children prepare for school. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 gave direct massive federal aid to public and parochial schools. A similar act provided college scholarships for needy students. The Great Society's War on Poverty extended federal influence into areas that had traditionally been handled by local governments, private enterprise, or religious groups. In some cases OEO was granted power to overrule local governments. The emphasis was not simply on relief but on helping poor people help themselves. For example, community action programs taught people to organize protests and put pressure on landlords, employers, and even government agencies to effect change. After nearly 20 years of opposition by those who believed that the government should stay out of health care, Congress passed the Medicare Act. Medicare provided people over age 65 with hospital care. Medical centers were to be set up in areas where such facilities were lacking. Chapter 33 The Vietnam Era Examining Maps The Voting Rights Act of 1965 had a dramatic effect on registration of African-American voters. How did it influence elections? The act provided funds for medical schools to increase enrollments and reduce the shortage of doctors. To many thousands of immigrants, the United States already represented a "great society"—a land of opportunity and freedom. The doors of this great society had opened wide to immigrants from northwestern Europe and nearly closed to others, because of a quota system established in 1924. Out of 157,000 immigrants admitted each year, Great Britain and Ireland were allotted 83,000; India, with a population of 450 million, and Andorra, with a population of 6,400, each were allotted 100. Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy had been unable to persuade Congress to change this system. Standing beneath the Statue of Liberty, which welcomed immigrants to the country, Johnson signed the Immigration Act of 1965. The law replaced national quotas with global quotas and favored those with special skills. As a result, immigration to the United States from Asia and Latin America increased sharply. Percent of blacks Less than 25% of voting age 25% to 49% registered mi More than 50% 1966 Voting Rights Act of 1965 In January 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., organized a voter registration drive in Selma, Alabama. The county sher iff deputized whites and attacked groups of blacks with dogs and cattle prods as they tried to register. Then on March 7 Dr. King organized a "march for freedom" from Selma, Alabama, to the state capitol in Montgomery, 50 miles away. Although federal laws had already granted them the vote, many blacks in the South were deprived of their rights by violence and threats of violence and by unfair and unevenly applied eligibility tests. In Selma 3 out of 4 blacks applying to vote were turned down. Dr. King wanted to dramatize this injustice through the march. About 35,000 people from all over the country joined in, more than 400 of them white clergy. Police armed with billy clubs, bullwhips, and tear gas, and urged on by angry mobs, met the marchers. Many marchers were injured in the clash that followed and 2 white demonstrators were killed. The marchers reached Montgomery only after Johnson sent federal troops to provide protection. National outrage over events in Selma helped speed the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It did away with such things as literacy tests in many southern states and provided for federal assistance in registering African Americans. Steps were also taken to eliminate the poll tax, forbidden by the Twenty-fourth Amendment, yet still used to keep the poor from voting. In a single year, more than 400,000 people, mostly blacks who had not previously voted, were registered. As a result, black candidates began to win elections as state legislators, mayors, and members of Congress. Within 25 years, the number of African-American elected officials in the South rose from 100 to 5,000. Southern politicians who had championed desegregation appealed to black voters for support in their election campaigns. John Lewis, the head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and later a member of the House of Representatives said: Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present These elections signal a new level of maturation in American politics. They demonstrate the willingness of white voters to set aside racial differences, and they reflect the fact that many minorities have gained the broad political experience and skills to make them solid candidates for major office. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 also helped other minorities. It overturned a New York state law requiring voters to be able to read English, enabling such groups as Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans to vote. Under Johnsons leadership Congress passed a great number of other important laws in a few' months. "We did reach con- sensus," he concluded. "I think we did convince the vast majority of Americans that the time for procrastinating had passed." His programs were well-received in part because people saw benefits for themselves. Some businesspeople, for example, benefited from the War on Poverty because of the increased purchasing power of poor people. Johnson's program also included subsidies to farmers. Great Society programs required large sums of money. Federal spending for social purposes rose from $54 billion in 1964 to $98 billion in 1968. By 1967 American involvement in the Vietnam war was costing more than $20 million a year. Federal budget problems and national inflation made Great Society spending an issue for debate. At first, Johnson tried to finance the war with taxes, explaining that the nation could afford both guns and butter. New social programs and rising war costs made the federal deficits climb to $28 billion by 1968. The President realized that without additional taxes, either social or military programs would have to be cut. He asked Congress for a tax increase. Congress refused unless the President would cut the budget. Johnson chopped $6 billion out of proposed domestic spending, marking the end of the Great Society. Section One Review Summary After the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Americans found President Johnson's strong leadership reassuring. Johnson used his political skills to form a consensus and to continue the domestic programs begun by Kennedy. Johnson's first achievement was passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After his election in 1964, Johnson set to work implementing his concept of the Great Society—a blueprint for the elimination of poverty and discrimination in America. Great Society programs offered training and opportunities to advance in American society. To end discrimination, Johnson backed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Checking for Understanding 1.

Supporting an Opinion In 1990, a Civil Rights Act was vetoed by President Bush because the bill contained hiring quotas. Compare Americans' attitudes toward civil rights today to their attitudes in the 1960s. Chapter 33 The Vietnam Era Among its early successes, NOW helped end separate classified ads for men and women and airline rules that required female flight attendants to retire at age 32. In the 1960s and 1970s, NOW aird similar groups encouraged increasing numbers of women to enter professions; banks, realtors, and department stores began to grant loans, mortgages, leases, and credit that they long had denied to female applicants. Following intense lobbying by women's groups, in 1972 Congress voted to submit the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the states for ratification. This amendment stated that "equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex." Not all women supported ERA, however. Phyllis Shlafly, founder of STOP ERA, dismissed the women's rights movement as "a series of sharp-tongued, high- pitched, whining complaints by unmarried women." STOP ERA supporters contended that the ERA would force women to give up their traditional roles as wives and mothers, and that they would lose certain legal protections in the family and in the workplace. As a result of a vigorous campaign by STOP ERA and other groups, the Equal Rights Amendment failed to obtain the votes needed for ratification. Changes for Minorities By the 1970s Hispanic Americans had become the largest minority in the United States next to African Americans. Spanish- speaking people made up almost 8 percent of the population and were the largest minority group in several states. New York City alone contained about 2 million Spanish-speaking people. Part of Miami, Florida, became known as Little Havana because it was the home of hundreds of thousands of Cuban immigrants. Mexican Americans made up the largest group of Hispanics. For years, many Mexican Americans labored as migrant farm workers, moving from place to place to harvest seasonal crops. They were not protected by federal minimu wage laws, unemployment insurance social security. In 1965 Cesar Chavez organized a nationwide coalition that asked Americans to boycott California grapes picked by nonunion labor. After enduring five years of such persistent protest, most California grape growers relented and agreed to sign a contract with Chavez's union. During the 1970s, inspired by the success of blacks in obtaining civil rights Flispanic Americans began to organize The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) won suits in federal Russell Means 1939- Russell Means, an Oglala Sioux, was born on a reservation in South Dakota. Raised in California, Means was taunted in high school by white classmates for being an Indian. During the 1960s he held a number of jobs and participated in Indian protests. Excited by the newly formed American Indian Movement in 1968, Means joined the leadership of the organization. Militant Indians hailed him as a hero as he protested against government policies toward native Americans. The most serious protest took place at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. In 1973 Means and his followers seized Wounded Knee and held it for 71 days, demanding a review of 300 treaties between the U.S. government and Indian nations. The Indians surrendered only after the government promised to investigate their complaints. 1020 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present courts to guarantee Hispanic Americans the right to serve on juries, to send their children to unsegregated schools, and to he taught in Spanish as well as in English. y\s their political strength grew, Hispanic Americans were elected to local and state offices as well as to Congress. Native Americans also organized during the 1960s and 1970s, Their plight captured national attention when a 1966 study revealed that native Americans suffered from so much malnutrition and disease that their life expectancy was only 46 years. They had less formal education than any other minority group, and their family income was less than one-half the national average. During the 1960s native Americans displayed a new militancy. In the state of Washington, men from more than 50 native American groups led a "fish-in." They deliberately broke game laws and risked imprisonment to protest the loss of their former fishing and hunting grounds. Proclaiming "red power," the National Congress of American Indians demanded the end to federal control of native American affairs. "We simply want to run our lives our own way," said a young leader of the congress. "Our own way" meant the revitalization of their traditional cultures. In 1973 a more militant group, the American Indian Movement (AIM), seized the reservation at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. They demanded that lands taken from native Americans in violation of federal treaties be returned. They also demanded that development programs on reservations be managed by Indian tribal government and not the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. Although the seizure ended and native American support was low, federal policies toward native Americans began to change. The Pueblo of Taos, New Mexico, regained Blue Lake, a place sacred to their religious life. In 1975 a federal court declared that the Passamaquoddy and the Penobscot tribes had a valid claim to more than half the state of Maine and to $25 billion in damages and unpaid rents. Section Three Review Summary Inspired by the energy and organization of the civil rights and antiwar movements, efforts to empower other minority groups and women began. The antiwar movement peaked with the killings at Kent State and Jackson State. The women's rights movement fought for equal pay and questioned traditional roles for women. A conservative backlash, however, prevented passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. Hispanic Americans worked for better treatment and organized a migrant farm workers union. Native Americans organized and worked to reverse the economic and social decline in their community. They won battles in court for land rights and financial compensation.

Willard Hunter Syndicated columnist, speech at Los Angeles Rotary Club, January 5, 1990 Section Focus While the general standard of living in America was rising in the 1980s, poverty and homelessness spread. Americans continued to buy more than they sold in world markets, resulting in trade deficits. Despite its economic problems, the United States remained a land of opportunity that attracted new immigrants from all regions of the globe. Objectives After studying this section, you should be able to: • Explain changes in America's balance of trade in the 1980s. • Identify three major problems faced by the United States and the world. The trade deficit represents the difference in value between goods Americans purchase from foreign nations and those they sell in foreign markets. This deficit reached a high of almost $152 billion in 1987. Some economists believed this created a serious balance of payments problem. Others, however, thought that President Nixon had solved the balance of payments problem in 1971 when hc announced that the United States would no longer redeem dollars with gold. This allowed the value of American currency to change according to the amount of dollars held in foreign countries. In the 1980s foreign investors used their excess dollars to buy American companies. This investment moved the United States from a creditor, or lending nation, to a debtor, or borrowing one. By 1987, for example, 1 in 5 Americans employed in the petroleum and mining industries worked for foreign-owned companies. From hotels along Waikiki Beach in Hawaii to Rockefeller Center in New York City, for- eign-owned buildings dotted the American skyline. The International Economy While foreign investment in the United States grew, so did American investment in other countries. Since the mid-1980s, America's foreign investment rose faster than that of its two largest competitors— Japan and Great Britain. Multinational corporations are companies that expand into other countries. American multinationals often built factories in developing nations where they paid workers less than workers in the United States were paid. While imports from multinationals added to what was counted as the trade deficit, these same foreign branches of United States companies sold hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods overseas. In 1986 the value of these sales was nearly 7 times the amount of the trade deficit for that year. A major global difficulty of the 1980s was debt. Developing nations, especially in Latin America and Africa, borrowed more than they could repay. The resulting debt crisis cost the United States and other trading countries billions of dollars in lost exports. Economists feared that if several of these countries defaulted, or did not pay their debt, the world economy would go into depression. 1072 Unit 10 Redefining America's Role: 1954-Present * Examining Photographs A shortage of consumer goods is one of the worries of Soviet leadership. Consumers queue up for hours to await an expected delivery of sausages. Emptied refrigerator shelves evidence the serious shortage of basic food supplies. Whom did Mikhail Gorbachev ask for economic support? Because of underproduction of basic goods, the Soviet Union and other Eastern European nations added to the worlds economic instability in the 1980s. As popular revolts threatened leaders of these communist nations, their governments took steps toward free-market economies. Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania ended Communist party domination and installed multiparty democratic systems. Led by Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet government promised its people reform. To make these changes, the Soviets and others asked for United States economic support. The United States, however, struggled with economic problems of its own. In 1990 events in the Persian Gulf intensified world economic difficulties. Saddam Hussein, leader of Iraq, invaded oil-rich Kuwait, gaining control of vital oil resources. The international community stood together in an economic blockade of Iraq, but most of the troops sent to protect nearby Saudi Arabia came from the United States. Mikhail Gorbachev, who had promised reform in the Soviet Union, struggled to hold his nation together. While he agreed to stop trade with Iraq, Gorbachev could offer little additional help in dealing with the latest Mideast crisis. Immigration World economic and political troubles in the 1980s brought a new tide of immigration to the United States. New immigration laws in 1965 had abolished the national quota system, making possible shifts in the pattern of immigration. In the decade after the new law, immigration from Europe fell 27 percent, while immigration from Latin America increased by 43 percent and from Asia by 369 percent. The new immigration created special problems for American schools. In most cases, English was the newcomers' second language. In some school districts in the southwest, in Florida, and in New York, the majority of students spoke Spanish. Schools struggled to create a balance between teaching students basic subjects in languages they understood and teaching them English. Many of the new immigrants were refugees, fleeing political persecution in such nations as Vietnam and Cuba or Linking Across Time Economic. Aid The Soviet Union had allied with the West in World War II. After the war, however, distrust led to the cold war. The United States, through the Marshall Plan, sent vast amounts of economic aid to Western Europe. Soviet-controlled Eastern European nations refused such aid. Soviet- controlled central planning stymied economic growth. At the beginning of the 1990s, the people of Eastern Europe and of the Soviet Union looked to the United States for aid, as they worked toward developing a market economy. Chapter 36 Americans in an Information Age 1073 fleeing from war in nations like El Salvador and Nicaragua. Illegal, or undocumented aliens, seeking jobs, crossed the American border in uncounted numbers. The combined total of legal and illegal immigrants to the United States during the 1980s was probably more than 1 million a year—the greatest influx since the early 1900s. Many of the newcomers took low-paying jobs that most Americans would not perform. The United States sought to stem the tide of illegal immigration without shutting the doors that had been open for generations. In 1986 Congress passed an alien amnesty act to enable immigrants who had entered the country illegally to become naturalized citizens. Those who applied and qualified were entitled to government benefits and protection. As President Reagan pointed out in a speech in Japan: We get new energy every year from the waves of immigrants who seek to make their lives and fortunes in our country.... Try convincing them that America's best days are behind her. Global Issues Threats to the environment and public health caused controversy in the 1980s. A debate arose between those who advocated environmental protection and those who favored greater development of natural resources. Environmentalists worried about such problems as "acid rain," caused by the emission of gases in the burning of fossil fuels by automobiles, Examining Graphs A change in the sources of immigration is reflected beginning in the 1960s. What two regions have contributed the most immigrants in the last thirty years?

The conflict between economic growth and environmental protection may well become the central issue of the next century. Arctic ecology research team The disappearing ozone layer—part of the upper atmosphere—is linked to the widespread use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), commonly found in such products as aerosols and foam packaging. Ozone depletion may cause an increase in skin cancer. Another concern is global warming caused by high levels of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat from the sun in the atmosphere and cause a greenhouse effect. The destruction of rain forests, which absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, compounds the problem. Many scientists believe that global warming could cause polar ice caps to melt, raising ocean levels and flooding coastal cities. Disposal of wastes, especially toxic and nuclear materials, will also be a continuing issue. The United States alone produces 40 million tons of toxic wastes annually. Making the Environment Connection 1. What is the cause of global warming? 2. How do vou think future technology will affect environmental problems? Linking Past and Present 3. What can individuals do to slow down the destruction of the environment? Connections industries, and plants that generate electricity. They saw acid rain kill fish, damage crops, and strip forests. They also blamed acid rain for afflicting people with respiratory diseases. On the other side, developers warned that strict laws against acid rain meant higher costs and loss of jobs. President Reagan's first Interior Secretary, James Watt, proposed to increase offshore oil drilling, to open wilderness areas to oil and gas exploration, and to relax federal air and water pollution standards. Watt believed these programs would help the nation fill its own energy needs and reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers, but environmentalists were outraged. Eventually, the controversies he stirred up and the stands he took forced his resignation. In 1989 Democratic majorities in Congress and President Bush reached agreement on tougher standards for automobile exhaust and other clean air hazards. The federal government considered other programs from recycling trash to protecting the earth's depleted ozone layer. Concern about the environment heightened further in 1989 when a tanker accident in Alaska caused the biggest oil spill in history. All sides seemed to recognize that human survival depended upon the fate of the earth's environment. Many agreed with Douglas Olesen, President of Battelle, an Ohio research institute, who said: So far we've focused ...on eliminating waste only on the very end of the production line___To cut waste at its source, maybe we'll have to change the way we make products. Maybe we'll even have to change the products themselves. Chapter 36 Americans in an Information Age 1075
