A basic question has beenrepeatedly asked: What does it mean to be anAmerican?Throughout the nation's history, many Ameri-cans have been intolerant of diversity. They havereadily accepted immigrants similar to themselvesbut eyed with suspicion and fear those who were"different.' This fear was particularly noticeable inthe early 1800s, when more than 2 million IrishCatholics entered the United States. A mayor ofBoston during the 1830s thought that the Irishwere so different that they would remain forever"distinct and hostile" to American ways.

Their languages,food, and customs seemed strange to native-bornAmericans - many of whom, ironically, were de-scendants of earlier immigrants, as shown in thecartoon on page 395. Immigrants who were Catho-lic or Jewish met religious prejudice, while new-comers from Asia felt the effects of racism.Many of the immigrants came from countrieswithout democratic governments, where supportfor communism, socialism, and anarchismwas beginning to spread. Communists thought thatproperty should be owned by society as a whole,and wanted everyone to have an equal shareof goods. Socialists wanted government to ownmajor industries to protect the public from whatthey saw as the abuses of free enterprise. And an-archists wanted to do away with government en-tirely. Nativists charged that immigrantsthreatened American democracy by bringingthese "foreign" ideas with them.Also, many immigrants who were unskilledor without money needed jobs quickly. Theyaccepted lower wages than native-born work-ers, and sometimes took the jobs of workers outon strike. American workers' fierce resentmentof such competition fueled the growing nativ-ism.1865-1910 Chapter 15393

African and Hispanic Americans borefar more than their fair share of thewar's burden. For example, only 10percent of the general population wasAfrican American, yet 18 percent of thetroops were black, and they suffered 23percent of the casualties. Likewise,California Hispanics, only 12 percentof the state's population, had 33 per-cent of its casualties.

History Through Literatureanny Santiago's first novel, Famous All Over TownD(1983), paints a picture of life in a Mexican-Americanneighborhood in Los Angeles. In this passage the youngnarrator, Rudy Medina, accompanies his father to ameeting of the Planning Commission at City Hall. They are goingto protest plans by the Southern Pacific Railroad to tear down thehouses on their street and rezone the area for a truck-loadingcenter.fromFamous All Over Townby Danny Santiago"City Planning Commission," a block of wood said in gold.There were nine planners present, each one with his private sign, such asLa Kretz, Torvaldsen, Kleinburger and other all-American names. You don't seemuch Gómez up there at City Hall, or García, at least not without a broomin hand. The Planners sat listening in fat green chairs and passed the time byputting their glasses on and taking them off. Of all those 18 hands there wasnot a single missing finger which would be a world record for any 9 of ourpeople. A tall, gray-haired, S-shape man was preaching from the pulpit infront. Mr. Cockburn they called him."What's he talking?" my father asked."All about a bunch of slums someplace," I answered. "They didn't gettoShamrock yet.'But I was wrong. Mr. Cockburn snapped his fingers and they splashed avery familiar picture on a big movie screen. My father gasped like shot. It wasour own home, and how mean and ugly we looked up there between thosemarble columns."Don't get mad, compadre, or we're dead," Chuchu whispered and slidin next to us. He'd come straight from the job and he pulled our petitionfrom his pocket and blew a cloud of cement off it, then cleared his throat soloud everybody turned to look. Chuchu waved and smiled at them. "Mr.o Gara will fix 'em, just wait and see," he said."Crack!" went Mr. Cockburn's fingers and another picture flashed up onthe screen and then another. He showed us a parade of Shamrock housesfrom Main Street to the tracks, except he skipped Don Tiburcio's pretty garden,I noted. While the picture show was going on, he talked building codes andwelfare families and dropouts from school. He preached Broken Homes andbusted sewer pipes, trains passing day and night and no foundations to thehouses. Too many kids to the bedroom caused TB and worse, he claimed.803Mr. Cockburn had figures on everything, arrests, probations,jails, sick and dead. And how he loved to add up all ourtroubles and all our little mistakes."Qué dice? What's he say?" my father kept asking me.But how could I keep up with all those ugly numbers?Was I deprived and disadvantaged like this man said, ordestituted? My father worked steady. I had never been sorry formyself before, except maybe two Christmases back. And here Iinnewas living in The Slums and never knew it, because by theE5time Mr. Cockburn added it all up, even a cucaracha[cockroach] would be ashamed to admit Shamrock Street washis home address.Next, Mr. Cockburn told what a fine place Shamrockwould be with all our little homes torn down. M-1 zoningwould bring 1,000 new jobs, so he said, and millions in taxdollars which seemed to cheer those city planners up. And finally, he said, thisrezone was in accordance with the City's own Master Plan for a moreup-to-date L.A."Describe the exact land use," they asked him.The S.P. would put a giant parking lot on top of us, he said, for theirpiggy-back trucks which would be loaded onto freight cars and speed updeliveries and reduce traffic on the freeways."What about the people who live there now?" Mr. Kleinburger asked. Heseemed quite concerned."They will receive fifty percent above the market price for their houses,"was Mr. Cockburn's answer. "They'll move to better neighborhoods with lowercrime rates, good schools, nice homes. We are actually paying them to tradeup into the American Standard of Living.The planners seemed quite pleased with the picture. "Are there anyopposed?" they asked. There was a big noisy silence. Chuchu looked round forhis lawyer friend and so did we."Then if nobody objects-"Me," Chuchu got up and said. "Me and eighty-three others of us." Hewaved our petition. Kindly bring it forward. He did. Was there any statementhe cared to make? There was. Then please use the microphone."Mr. Chairman, respected publicThere stood Chuchu in his overalls from work and cement dust in hishair, and he looked out over that sea of neckties."Check his list against the tax roll," the head planner told the clerk.Chuchu looked at us like a drowning man, then finally found his voice."Knock on the walls," he said, "we're pure lath and plaster down thereon Shamrock, no cheap wallboard.

And Shamrock, it's heaven compared to that.'The planners started coughing and checkingwristwatches. The clerk interrupted to report only 22 out ofour 83 names were on the tax rolls."Where did you get the other signatures?" the head planner sternlyasked."They live on Shamrock, every one of them," Chuchu answered."But not taxpayers.'"Sure they pay their taxes," Chuchu said, "if not on homes, then oncigarettes, beers, cars, underwear, the works."That brought quite some laugh."Are we ready to vote?" the planners asked."May I first say a few words?" Mr. Cockburn asked and turned to Chu-chu. "Mr. Madrigal,' he said, "we of the S.P. railroad consider you folks ourvery good neighbors. Many of you are in our employ. Rather than deprivingyou of your homes we're opening the door to a better and a richer life-Mr. Cockburn never finished because a new voice came booming fromthe back of the hall."Yes, you love your neighbors so much you're ready to gobble them upall the way to their bloody bootstrings! From the sound of him, I expected atleast a 10-foot giant to come tromping down the aisle but what came was ahunched-up monkey of a man on wheels. He came spinning down betweenthose benches and pulled up by the microphone on squealing rubber."Mr. Cockburn sir, I listened with concern to your despressing statisticsbut there is one pertinent figure you seem to have overlooked. Tell me, Mr.Cockburn, just how many young men from Shamrock died on the bloodyfields of Europe and Asia? You don't know, Mr. Cockburn? Tss tss, perhaps myclient Mr. Madrigal can tell us.""Seventeen," Chuchu said, "not including Augie Martinez.""Seventeen, Mr. Cockburn!" and how that man made those numbersring.
