Diplomatic efforts to end these French raids failed. In truth, the United States was in a war—an undeclared war on the ocean. Adams also faced troubles on the home front. At least 25,000 French refugees (people who leave home to escape danger) had come to the United States. In addition, a large number of refugees from a 1798 Irish rebellion against British rule found shelter here. Many of the Federalist politicians were suspicious of the foreigners and worried about what these people might do. Congress tried to solve the problem by passing several laws. One, the Alien Act, gave the President the power to expel foreigners suspected of illegal activities in this country. Another law, the Naturalization Act, increased the residency requirement for citizenship. Previously, a foreigner could become a citizen after 5 years in this country. This waiting period was raised to 14 years. Was it not true, the Federalists A Half Century of Independence 189 reasoned, that most naturalized foreigners (those who had become citizens) voted for the Republicans? Why not then make it harder for the Republicans to win new voters? Republican politicians and editors attacked Adams and his policies fiercely and endlessly. The Federalists answered by accusing the Republicans of sedition (stirring up resistance to the government's authority). Influenced by the Federalists, Congress passed the Sedition Act. It set penalties for such activities. There follows an exchange of letters between John Adams and Abigail Adams, his wife. The letters have been adapted from the originals. As you read them, notice how strongly both felt about a Republican writer. Ask yourself why the Adamses believed that this person was guilty of sedition. Did the Sedition Act violate the rights of freedom of the press guaranteed in the First Amendment? Philadelphia. 1798 Dear Abigail, 1 wish I had good news to tell you, but everything bothers me. I feel old—very old. I know that 1 shall never feel very well while I am President. The drudgery, the work, of this job is too much for me. If only I were a little stronger. Why do 1 feel this way? I simply cannot stand the pressures of those Jacobin writers. [The Jacobins were a radical political group in the French Revolution. Adams used the term for Americans he thought too radical.] You know that we are almost at war with the French. And you know howT hard I work to protect our country. Yet what is my reward? Not a word of praise comes from the pens of those radical writers. All they do is attack, attack! Why can't they leave me alone? Why can't they understand that I am strengthening and defending the United States? I am sure that you will agree that the w'orst of these writers is Benjamin Franklin's grandson, Benjamin Franklin Bache. His pen drips w-ith acid. His words are disgraceful lies, and his sentences are 4 An Immigrant Discovers America During the late 1800's, industrial America needed many laborers to build railroads, mine minerals, and work in factories. It needed people willing to do hard and dirty work. America needed immigrants. Between 1860 and 1900, some 14 million immigrants poured into the United States. The nation's population more than doubled, reaching 76 million. Immigrants contributed greatly to that growth. Most of the newcomers were Europeans, but a number came from China and Japan. Chinese workers helped to build the transcontinental railroads. Japanese labor harvested fruits and vegetables on the West Coast. Immigrants who came before 1870 were called "old immigrants." They were usually from Northern European countries, and many could read and write. But after 1870, most immigrants came from Southern and Eastern Europe. These "new immigrants" were often unskilled and illiterate. They crowded into slum sections of cities. Many Americans looked down upon these newcomers. They blamed "new immigrants" for high crime rates, filthy streets, and even political corruption. It wasn't long before laws were passed to keep "unwelcome" newcomers out. In 1882 Congress passed a Chinese Exclusion Act halting immigration from China for ten years. In 1907 the Japanese government agreed to prevent its laborers from going to America. The Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924 stopped almost all immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. Why did immigrants come to America? What were they looking for? What did America mean to them? New York City, 1896 Benjamin tossed restlessly in his bed. In a few hours he would be reunited with his wife and children. He had not seen them for five years. Thinking about his family brought back memories of the old country, of Russian Poland. He remembered the poverty, hunger, and illness. He thought about the people who said awful things to II him and sometimes struck him with their fists just because he didn't believe in their religion. It hadn't been easy being a Jew in the old country. No matter how hard he had worked, he still had not been I able to feed and clothe his family properly. He thought back to the I many nights he and his wife went to bed hungry so that the little I ones could have a bit more to eat. 336 Enjoying American History Life in the old country became so difficult that Benjamin decided to leave. He borrowed money from his family and friends and set out for America. He had to leave his family behind until he was settled in the new country. Benjamin arrived in America with very little money. He knew little about the country. He could neither speak nor write the English language. All he possessed was a willingness to work hard—that and a dream. His dream was that his children would grow strong in this new country. Here, he hoped, they would at least have a chance to make something of their lives. Benjamin rented the cheapest room he could find in a neighborhood that housed others of the Jewish faith. With the guidance of some of his neighbors, he was able to find work right away. He did not care what sort of work he did. He swept floors, washed dishes, emptied trash cans, and did anything else that was asked of him. Benjamin also toiled at a sewing machine in a factory. He took jobs other people did not want because the work was hard and the pay low. There were immigrants like him all over America. They were building railroads, digging canals, drilling for oil, planting and farming, working in mines and factories. As in the old country, Benjamin worked long hours for little pay. For working 10 to M hours a day, 6 days a week, he earned $8 or $9. Saving money was difficult, but Benjamin was determined to save enough to bring his family over. He took a cheap room in a tenement in a slum. His room had no window and no heat, so he roasted in the summer and froze in the winter. On summer nights he escaped to the roof or to the streets for some fresh air. Often Benjamin ate no more than a buttered roll for his main meal. His nights were lonely. He missed his family terribly. America was different from the old country, Benjamin felt. Here a person could improve his life. Benjamin enrolled in night school and learned to speak, read, and write English. He began to make Key: Northern and Central Europe Eastern and Southern Eutope Asia Canada Latin America All Other Areas 1820-1870 Approximately 7,5 million 1871-1920 Approximately 27 million Immigration to the United Slates, 1820-1920 The Industrial Revolution Comes of Age plans for himself. Even after his family came to America, he would continue to save money. With these savings he would buy a little shop. He wanted to earn enough money so that he wotdd never have to work for someone else again. In America, even a poor immigrant like Benjamin could have dreams like this. Still Benjamin thought that in some ways America was like the old country. There were people here w'ho snubbed him because he was not of their faith or because he looked "different." Others worried that he would take their jobs. Some said that immigrants like Benjamin were criminals who made the streets unsafe. Benjamin was puzzled by people like this. Didn't they see that most of the "Benjamins" of America worked hard and went to school to learn how to become good citizens in their adopted country? That they respected America's laws and taught their children these same values? Benjamin had great plans for his children. He wanted them to get a good education. He believed that in America, a person could become whatever he or she wanted to lie. His children would have good jobs. They might become doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, or business people. He, Benjamin, would help them succeed. America had given Benjamin a new home and an opportunity to succeed. Benjamin would repay his adopted land by giving it his loyalty, his children, and the sweat of his brow. With a feeling of joy, Benjamin leaped out of bed. He would put on his best suit. Today his family was starting a new' life with him in America. Immigrants have brought much with them to America, and America is richer because of them. They have brought their music, dance, customs, foods, and ideas. Immigrants have also made great contributions in science, medicine, mathematics, literature, and art. Without their contributions, it is unlikely that the United States would be the great country it is today. There are still oppressed people in the world. Most nourish the dream that their children will grow up in a free society. For many such people, America continues to be a haven and a land of opportunity. Homework Questions 1. In what ways did immigrants contribute to the growth of America? 2. Why were "new immigrants" not accepted as easily as "old immigrants"? 3. How was immigration from China restricted by Congress? 4. Why do people from other countries still want to come to the United Slates? 5. How would you describe Benjamin's life in America? The Return to Normalcy -109 evidence is so flimsy and has so many contradictions, it just doesn't seem fair to send Sacco and Vanzetti to the chair. Vincent. You worn' too much, Anthony. If they're guilty, they've got to pay. Anthony. If—if—if! How can we take their lives unless we know' for sure? After two months of study, the governor's committee reported its find- ings—the trial had been fair; the men were guilty. At midnight on August 23, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti died in the electric chair. By this time many Americans were convinced that the two were being put to death for their political beliefs. Up to the very end, both men insisted that they were innocent. Vanzetti, who learned to read and write English in jail, told a reporter: "If it had not been for this thing, we might have died unknowns, failures. Never could we hope to do such work for justice, for man's understanding of man. Next to this, our lives are nothing. This last moment belongs to us." To this day the Sacco-Vanzetti case continues to stir debate. Many people now feel that one or both of the men were probably innocent. Even many who believe them guilty say they did not get a fair trial. To compensate in part for what he called the injustice of 1927, Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis signed a proclamation about the Sacco-Van- zetti case in 1977. Dukakis said the men did not get a fair trial because of their foreign background and political beliefs. During the 1920's, many members of Congress shared in the widespread distrust of foreigners. The Emergency Quota Act of 1921 limited the number of newcomers to be admitted. It set an annual quota for each European nation. This number reflected the proportion of people born in that nation who lived in the United States in 1910. Many Americans complained that the new quotas let in too many immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. In 1924, new quotas were set. This time they were based on the U.S. population of 1890, before many people had immigrated from Southern and Eastern Europe. The result was to close off most new immigration from those regions. Congress wanted immigrants to come mainly from Northern Europe, from countries such as England, Germany, and Sweden. Asians were barred altogether. Beginning in 1929, immigration quotas were based on the U.S. census of 1920. The total number of immigrants was set at 150,000 a year, far below the numbers that had streamed in during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1952 the McCarran-Walter Act lifted the ban on immigrants from Asian and Pacific nations. The immigration quota system was further changed in 1965. A new immigration act established a quota of 170,000 immigrants per year from the Eastern Hemisphere. A total of 20,000 persons per year would be admitted from any one country in that area. For the Western Hemisphere, a limit of 120,000 persons per year was established, with no quota per country. These laws have encouraged immigration from Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Southern and Eastern Europe. From World War 11 (o the 1950's 475 were issued to limit the amount of butter, meat, gasoline, and certain types of clothing a person could buy. Some 16 million Americans entered the armed forces, including 216,000 women in noncombat units. The total spending of government during the war came to $330 billion, which was 15 times as much as in World War I. World War II was not as idealistic a crusade as World War I, and there was less interference with people who spoke out against the war. But one group of people suffered special penalties. This group was composed of some 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry who lived along the West Coast. About one third of them were Japanese citizens, and two thirds were American citizens. For many years, Japanese immigrants had faced harsh treatment from whites. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, some Americans feared that such people might give help to Japan, especially if Japan invaded the West Coast. The federal government ordered people of Japanese ancestry living along the coast to leave their homes and businesses. They were moved to internment camps, where many of them were housed for most of the war. Eventually, some Japanese-Americans were allowed to join the U.S. armed forces and take part in the war.
