they were suffering not only from falling prices hut also from rising taxes and the high fees imposed by proprietary officials. To quiet the Protestant rebels, the Lords of Trade suspended Lord Baltimore's proprietorship, imposed royal government, and established the Church of England as the colony's official church. This settlement lasted until 1715, when Benedict Calvert, the fourth Lord Baltimore, converted to the Anglican faith and the Crown restored the proprietorship to the Calvert family (which held it until the American Revolution). With the government firmly in Protestant hands and with Catholics forced to practice their faith in private, political conflict diminished, and a united governing class emerged. As in Virginia, the main lines of social division in Maryland now involved class and race, with a planter elite controlling a population of servants, slaves, and tenants. In Maryland, the uprisings of 1689 had eliminated Catholicism as a major political force. Ethnic Rebellion in New York. In New York the Glorious Revolution produced even more ethnic and religious strife, class tension, and political instability. After England conquered New Netherland in 1664, James II (as duke of York) imposed strict authoritarian rule, prohibiting representative institutions. However, he did not expel or persecute the Dutch residents; indeed, he allowed the Rensselaers and other Dutch manorial lords to retain their large land holdings, and most of the Dutch inhabitants remained in the colony. Thirty years later nearly 60 percent of the taxpayers in New York City were Dutch artisans and shopkeepers. As proud Protestants from Holland, they welcomed the accession of Mary and her Dutch husband to the English throne. In 1689, a month after the uprising in Boston, the New York militia ousted Colonel Francis Nicholson, who, under Sir Edmund Andros, was lieutenant governor of New York and New Jersey. Dutch artisans in New York City joined with Puritan farmers on Long Island in this attack on Nicholson, an alleged Catholic sympathizer, and other "Popish Doggs & Divclls" appointed by James II. They replaced Nicholson with Jacob Leisler; a migrant German soldier who had married into a prominent Dutch merchant family. At first Leisler had the support of all classes and ethnic groups, but when he freed debtors from prison and urged the creation of a more democratic, town-meeting form of government, this solidarity disintegrated. In the political struggle that followed. Dutch artisans in New York City sided with Leisler, taking control of the ten-member Board of Aldermen, while wealthy merchants, who had traditionally controlled the city government, attacked the legitimacy of Leisler's seizure of power. Class animosity suffused a pamphlet written by a merchant, Nicholas Bayard, who accused Leisler of being like a "Masaniello," the peasant fishmonger who in 1647 had led a popular revolt in Naples, Italy. Leisler held on to power until 1691, when he was forced to surrender to Henry Sloughter, the new royal governor. Influenced by Bayard and his wealthy merchant friends, Sloughter had Leisler and seven of his associates indicted for treason. An English jury convicted Leisler and Jacob Milburne, his son-in-law, and the two men were hanged and then decapitated—treatment reserved for those found guilty of the most heinous crimes. A new Board of Aldermen, dominated again by merchants, passed ordinances reducing artisans' wages. These measures broke the power of the Dutch artisans, but political conflict between the Leislerian and anti-Leislerian factions continued until the 1710s. The Glorious Revolution of 1688-1689 began a new phase in English imperial history. In America, the uprisings in Boston and New York toppled the author) tarian institutions of the Dominion of New England and restored internal self-government. In England, a new constitutional monarchy gave effective controLof the affairs of state to representatives of the propertied classes. These men promoted an empire based on commerce by curbing royal monopolies (such as the East India and Royal African companies), giving free rein to enterprising merchants and financiers, and developing the American colonies as a source of trade. A Prosperous Dutch Farmstead Many Dutch farmers in the Hudson River Valley prospered, because of easy access to markets and their exploitation of black slaves. To record his success, Martin Van Bergen of Leeds, New York, had this mural painted over his mantelpiece. Chapter 4 Growth .mil t risis in American Society 1720-1"65 perhaps 150 to 180 bushels of grain. After meeting its own needs, the family might sell the surplus for £15, enough to buy salt and sugar, tools, cloth, and perhaps a few acres of new land. The Emergence of Inequality. Rural Pennsylvania was initially a land of economic equality. In Chester County, for example, the original migrants came with approximately the same resources (see Figure 4.2). In 1693, the poorest 30 percent of the taxpayers owned a substantial 17 percent of the assessed wealth and the top 10 percent controlled only 23 percent. Most families lived in small houses with one or two rooms. Their furniture consisted of a few benches or stools and a bed in a loft. Only the wealthiest families ate off pewter or ceramic plates imported from England or Holland. The great majority consumed their simple fare from wooden trenchers (platters) and drank from wooden noggins (cups). The rise of the wheat trade—and the influx of poor settlers—introduced marked social divisions. By the 1760s some farmers had grown wealthy by hiring the poor and using their labor to raise large quantities of wheat for market sale. Others had become successful entrepreneurs, providing newly arrived settlers with land, equipment, goods, and services. These large-scale farmers, rural landlords, speculators, storekeepers, and gristmill operators gradually formed a new class of wealthy agricultural a.ipitalists—the owners of productive property. The estate inventories of this economic elite include mahogany tables, four-poster beds, table linen, couches, and imported Dutch dinnerware—all of which testify to growing economic inequality. In the 1760s the richest 10 percent of the Chester County's property-owning families controlled 30 percent of their communities' assets, while the poorest 30 percent held a mere 6 percent. Moreover, a new landless class, one with no taxable property, had appeared at the bottom of the social order. In five agricultural towns in New Jersey in the 1760s, half the white men aged eighteen to twenty-five were without land, while in Chester County, Pennsylvania, nearly half of all white men were propertyless. Some landless men were the sons of property owners and would eventually inherit at least a part of the family estate. But just as many were Scors-Irish inmates, single men or families "such as live in small cottages and have no taxable property, except a cow," as the tax assessor in the Scots-Irish township of Londonderry explained. There was also an "abundance of Poor people" in the predominantly German settlement of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. A merchant noted that they "maintain their Families with great difficulty by day Labour." These landless Scots-Irish and German migrants hoped to improve their lot by becoming tenants and then landowners, but such goals were either unrealistic or very hard to achieve. Land prices had risen sharply in settled areas with good transportation, and the acquisition of a farmstead was the work of a lifetime. Merchants and artisans took advantage of the ample supply of labor by organizing a putting-out system: they bought wool or flax from some farm families and paid others to spin it into yarn or weave it into cloth. An English traveler reported in the 1760s that hundreds of Pennsylvanians had turned "to manufacture, and live upon a small farm, as in many parts of England." By that time eastern areas of the middle colonies, as well as New England, had become as crowded and socially divided as many regions of rural England. | 80 c* = 60 3 50 z 40 5 30 § 20 N n - 24% Top 10% of taxpayers \ 38% - - 59% Middle 60% of taxpayers Bottom 30% t >f taxpayers 58% - t" 1"% 4% 4 tv 1700 1715 1730 1745 1760 1782 1800 Increasing Social Inequality in Chester County, Pennsylvania By renting land and selling goods to a growing population, the county's landed and commercial elite grew rich. Eventually the top tenth of the taxpayers commanded nearly 40 percent of the wealth, far above the paltry 4 percent owned by the poorest 30 percent. The Mid-Atlantic: Toward a New Society, 1720-1765 Tenancy on the Hudson Manors. Migrants to New York faced an even more arduous road to land ownership. Long-established Dutch families—the Rcnsselaers, the Van Cortlandts, the Philipses—still presided over the patroonships created by the Dutch Wesr India Company in the fertile Hudson River Valley (see Map 4.2). The first English governors of New York augmented the ranks of this landowning class by bestowing huge tracts of land on the Livingston, Morris, and 1 leathcotc families. These clans had a stranglehold on the best land and refused to sell an acre of it. They wanted to live like European aristocrats, masters of scores of tenant families. For that reason, many migrants refused to settle in the Hudson River Valley. In 1714 the manor of Rensse- laerswyck had only 82 tenants on hundreds of thousands of acres. But gradually population growth caused a scarcity of freehold land in eastern New York, and more families were forced to accept tenancy leases. To attract tenants, the lords of the manors began to grant long leases and the right to sell (to the next tenant) any improvements made to the property. Thus, Rensselaer- swyck had 345 tenants in 1752 and nearly 700 by 1765. With determination, luck, and wheat profits, some tenants saved enough to buy freehold property, but the Hudson River Valley remained primarily a region of tenant farmers, distinct from the predominantly freehold communities in Pennsylvania, New jersey, and New England. Even communities of yeomen farm families were increasingly divided by economic interests and class position. In Pennsylvania, gentlemen farmers and commercial middlemen had grown rich whereas tier- man and Scots-Irish inmates still struggled for subsistence. In New England, which lacked a major export crop, many small-scale freeholders had fallen into debt; even the most creative farmers could generate only a limited surplus. Throughout the mainland colonies, smallholding farm families worried about finding enough land to give their children and feared—with good reason—a return to the exploited status of the European peasantry. Ethnic Diversity When the Swedish traveler Peter Kalm visited Philadelphia in 1748, he found no fewer than twelve religious denominations, including Anglicans, Quakers, Swedish and German Lutherans, Scots-Irish Presbyterians, and even Roman Catholics. Large communities of German sectarians, such as the Moravians in the Pennsylvania towns of Bethlehem and Nazareth, added to this religious diversity. The Quaker Experiment. Members of the Society of Friends (Quakers) were the dominant social group in V. lirt Cnr# MANOH saint oeoaoE manor island ----- Manor boundary -----Deputed *tat" boundary The Hudson River Manors Dutch and English manorial lords dominated the fertile eastern shores of the I ludson River Valley— leasing small farms to German tenant families and refusing to sell land to migrants from overcrowded New England. From this powerful elite emerged Patriot leaders, such as Gouverneur Morris (see American Lives, pages 2l>4-205), and influential American families, such as the Roosevelts. Chapter 4 Growth and Crisis in American Society 1720-1 "65 A Quaker Meeting for Worship Quakers dressed plainly and met in plain, unadorned buildings. They sat in silence, speaking only when inspired by the "inner light." Women spoke frequently and were listened to with respect, an experience that prepared Quaker women to take a leading pan in the nineteenth-century women's rights movement. This British work, entitled Quaker Meeting, shows an elder (his hat placed temporarily on a peg above his head) exhorting the congregation. Pennsylvania, at first because they outnumbered the others and later because, despite a huge influx of new migrants after 1720, they retained wealth and influence. Quakers controlled Pennsylvania's representative assembly (established by the proprietor William l'enn's Frame of Government) until the 1750s and exercised considerable power in New' Jersey. Quakers had a distinct social ethic. They wore plain clothes without elaborate decoration and refused to defer to their "superiors" by removing their hats. In talking among themselves and with strangers, they used the familiar "thee" and "thou" rather than the more formal "you." Friends refused to use law courts to settle disputes among themselves, relying instead on arbitrators to judge what was "right," not simply what was "legal." Around 1750 some Quakers extended these egalitarian values to their relations with blacks, freeing their own slaves. Indeed, some Quaker meetings not only condemned the institution of slavery but also expelled any members who continued to keep slaves, making Quakers the first religious group to advocate the abolition of slavery. Quakers were pacifists, and so they avoided war with native Americans. Penn negotiated the firsr treaty with the Delaware Indians in 1682, and the Pennsylvania government purchased Indian land rather than seizing it by force. These conciliatory policies enabled Pennsylvania to avoid a major Indian w'ar until the 1750s, a record unmatched elsewhere in the British colonies. In diplomacy as in religious matters. the Quakers' radical social experiment was largely successful and attracted thousands of migrants from eighteenth-century Europe. T he Pennsylvania Germans. Germans came to the middle colonies in a series of waves, tlecing their homeland because of war, religious persecution, and poverty. First to arrive, in 1683, was a group of Mennonites attracted by Penn's pamphlet promising religious freedom. Beginning in 1709, boatloads of impoverished peasants from the Palatine region of western Germany, an area devastated by religious warfare, settled as tenants on Hudson River manors. Then, in the 1720s, continuing religious upheaval and population growth in southwestern Germany and Switzerland stimulated another wave of migrants. "Wages were far better than here," Heinrich Schneebeli reported to his friends in Zurich after an exploratory trip to Pennsylvania, and "one also enjoyed there a free unhindered exercise of religion." Thirty citizens of Zurich immediately asked the authorities for permission to emigrate. Many Germans and Swiss had the resources to pay their own way; they migrated to provide better opportunities for their children. Others signed on as redemptioners, a kind of indentured servant, to get to Pennsylvania (see American Voices, page 113). In 1749, after the War of the Austrian Succession, thousands of Germans and Swiss fled their overcrowded and war-torn homeland for the middle colonies. By 1754, when the outbreak of the Seven Years War (the European component of the Great War Gottlieb Mittelberger The Perils of Migration Tile lure of ample land and a better life prompted thousands of Germans to endure the hardships of migration, which were described in a book published by Gottlieb Mittelberger in 1750. A Lutheran minister who returned to Germany, Mittelberger viewed America with a critical eye, warning his readers of the difficulties of life in a competitive, pluralistic society. |The journey from Germany to Pennsylvania via Holland and England] lasts from the beginning of May to the end of October, fully half a year, amid such hardships as no one is able to describe adequately with their misery. Both in Rotterdam and in Amsterdam the people are packed densely, like herrings so to say, in the large sea-ves- sels. One person receives a place of scarcely 2 feet width and 6 feet length in the bedstead, while many a ship carries four to six hundred souls. ... During the journey rhe ship is full of pitiful signs of distress—smells, fumes, horrors, vomiting, various kinds of sea sickness, fever, dysentery, headaches, heat, constipation, boils, scurvy, cancer, mouth-rot, and similar afflictions, all of them caused by the age and the highly-salted state of the food, especially of the meat, as well as hy the very bad and lilrhv water, which brings about the miserable destruction and death of many. . . . All this misery reaches its climax when in addition to everything else one must also suffer through two to three days and nights of storm with everyone convinced that the ship with all aboard is bound to sink. In such misery all the people on hoard pray and cry pitifully together. Children between the ages of one and seven seldom survive the sea voyage; and parents must often watch their offspring suffer miserably, die, and be thrown into the ocean, from want, hunger, thirst, and the like. I myself, alas, saw such a pitiful fate overtake thirty-two children on hoard our vessel, all of whom were finally thrown into the sea. Their parents grieve all the more, since their children do not find repose in the earth, but are devoured by the predatory fish of the ocean. It is also worth noting that children who have not had either measles or smallpox usually get them on board the ship and for the most part perish as a result. When the ships finally arrive in Philadelphia after the long voyage only those are let off who can pay their sea freight or can give good security. The others, who lack rhe money to pay, have to remain on hoard until they are purchased and until their purchasers can thus pry them loose from rhe ship. In this whole process the sick are the worst off, for the healthy are preferred and are more readily paid for. The miserable people who are ill must often still remain at sea and in sight of the city for another two or three weeks—which in many cases means death. Yet many of them, w'ere they able to pay their debts and to leave the ships at once, might escape with their lives. Thus let him who wants to earn his piece of bread honestly and m a Christian manner and who can only do this by manual labor in his native country stay there rather than come to America. But the fact that so many still go to America and especially to Pennsylvania is to be blamed on the swindles and persuasions practiced by so-called Newlanders. These thieves of human beings tell their lies to people of various classes and professions, among whom may lie found many soldiers, scholars, artists, and artisans. They abduct people from their Princes and Lords and ship them to Rotterdam or Amsterdam for sale. There they get three florins, or one ducat, from the merchant, for each person ten years or older. On rhe other hand the merchants get from sixty to seventy or eighty florins for such a person in Philadelphia, depending on the debts that said person has incurred on the voyage.. ..

German settlements soon dominated certain areas of the rich Lancaster plain in Pennsylvania. Other groups moved down the Shenandoah Valley into the western districts of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Most of them managed to improve their lives. As the German minister Gottlieb Mittelberger reported from Pennsylvania in the 1750s, "Even in rhe humblest or poorest houses, no one eats bread without butter or cheese." These migrants did not seek to create an all- German colony but were content to live in a British- defined political community. Ibis decision reflected their class origins and religious ideology; few' came from politically active segments of German society, and many Chapter 4 Growth and Crisis in American Society 1720-1765 German Artisanry German artisans in Pennsylvania, carrying on the traditions of the old country, frequently decorated their furniture with abstract designs and simple folk motifs, such as the rectangular patterns and angels on this chest of drawers. religious sectarians explicitly rejected political activism. They slid easily into the status of loyal subjects of the German (and German-speaking) Hanoverian king of England, engaging in politics only to protect their religious liberty and property rights. Most Germans, however, sought to guard their linguistic and cultural heritage. A minister in North Carolina admonished his congregation "not to contract any marriages with the Finglish or Irish," explaining that "we owe it to our native country to do our part that German blood and the German language be preserved in America." In fact, most American-born Germans took marriage partners of their own ancestry, spoke to each other and read newspapers in German, and attended church services conducted in German. They also continued German agricultural practices: English visitors to the middle colonies remarked that German women were "always in the fields, meadows, stables, etc. and do not dislike any work whatsoever." The Scots-lrish. The Scots-Irish made up the largest group of new migrants to British North America, with some 150,000 arriving between 1720 and 1776. They' settled throughout the mainland but primarily in the middle colonies and the southern backcountry. These migrants were Presbyterians, the descendants of Scots who had been sent to northern Ireland to bolster English control there in the mid-seventeenth century. In Ireland the Scots had faced discrimination and economic regulation from the dominant English. For example, the Test Act of 1704 excluded both Scottish Presbyterians and Irish Catholics from holding public office in Ireland, reserving this privilege for members of the Church of England. English mercantilist regulations placed heavy import duties on the woolen goods produced by Scots-Irish farmers and weavers. Rising taxes and poor harvests stimulated a major Scots-Irish migration to America during the 1720s. "Read this letter, Rev. Baptist Boyd," a New York settler wrote back to his minister, "and tell all the poor folk of ye place that God has opened a door for their deliverance. . . . all that a man works for is his own; there are no revenue hounds [tax collectors! to take it from us here." I.ured by such reports, thousands of Scots-Irish sailed for Philadelphia and spread out across the mid-Atlantic region and southward down the Shenandoah Valley. Like the Germans, the Scots-Irish were determined to keep the culture of their homelands alive. They held to their Presbyterian faith and encouraged marriages within the church. The middle colonies were not a "melting pot"; the diverse European cultures did not blend together to produce a homogeneous "American" outlook but kept their separate identities. Thus, defying New York law, many Dutch families maintained inheritance practices that favored wives over children. The major exception to cultural separatism was the Huguenots, French Calvinists who were expelled from France and settled in New York and various seacoast cities; they intermarried with other Protestants during the eighteenth century. More typical was the experience of Welsh Quakers; 70 percent of the children of the original migrants to Chester County, Pennsylvania, married other Welsh Quakers, as did 60 percent of the third generation. By marrying within their own groups, these and other European settlers created a pluralistic society of diverse nationalities, cultures, and religions in the middle colonies. A Pluralistic Society In their religious and ethnic diversity', the mid-Atlantic colonies constituted a society' distinct from Europe (see Map 4.3). In Western Europe pluralism in religion was an untried experiment, and even in America most Euro- pean-trained ministers remained committed to religious uniformity enforced by an established church backed by the government. "Throughout Pennsylvania the preachers do not have the power to punish anyone, or to force anyone to go to church," Gottlieb Mittelberger complained. As a result, "Sunday is very badly kept. .The Mid-Atlantic: Toward a New Society. 1720-1765 Religious Diversity itt 1750 By 1750 religious diversity was on the rise. Baptists had grown in numbers in New England—long the stronghold of Congregationalism—and would later dominate Virginia. Already there were pockets of Presbyterians and Lutherans in the South, where Anglicanism was the established religion. Many people plough, reap, thresh, hew' or split wood and the like." He concluded that "Liberty in Pennsylvania does more harm than good to many people, both in soul and body." Mittclberger failed to appreciate the power of communal self-discipline. The various religious sects in Pennsylvania enforced moral behavior among their members. Each Quaker family, for example, regularly attended a weekly meeting for worship and a monthly meeting that handled discipline. A committee met with each family four times a year and made certain that its children received proper religious instruction. The committee also reported on the moral behavior of adults. In Chester County the men acted on such a report by disciplining one of their members "to reclaim him from drinking to excess and keeping vain company." Communal sanctions also effectively sustained a self-contained and prosperous Quaker community. Permission to marry was granted only to couples with sufficient land, livestock, and equipment to support themselves and their future children. Marriage with non-Quakers usually was prohibited, and those who disobeyed were treated as outcasts. In Chester County about two-thirds of the young men and women who married outside the faith were barred from Quaker meetings. Over the generations this strict system shaped the character of the Quaker community. The children of well-to-do Friends had ample marriage portions and usually married within the sect. Those who lacked the resources remained unmarried or left the Society. Thus the Quakers created a prosperous religious community of urban merchants and rural freeholders. Clearly, a single established church was not necessary to avoid social chaos. Yet Pennsylvania did not escape the tensions inherent in a society composed of distinct ethnic groups. By the 1750s Pennsylvania politics was sharply divided along cultural and religious lines. Scots-Irish Presbyterians on the frontier were challenging the pacifism of the Quaker-dominated assembly and demanding a more aggressive policy toward the Indians. Newer German migrants, many of whom belonged to Lutheran and Reformed churches, also opposed the Quakers; they wanted laws that respected their inheritance customs (which gave the community some say in the disposition of a family's property) and representation in the provincial assembly in proportion to their numbers. Otjier Germans, particularly the Mennonites, supported the Quakers because of their pacifism. Religious outlook increasingly determined political allegiance. As one observer noted, Scots-Irish Presbyterians, German Baptists, and German Lutherans had begun to form "a general confederacy" against the "ruling party'" of Quakers in Pennsylvania, bur this alliance was fragile. A foreign visitor remarked during the 1750s that these groups had "a mutual jealousy, for religious zeal is secretly burn- ing." Latent religious and ethnic passions would break out during the following decade and again during the War for Independence, nearly destroying the new republican government of Pennsylvania. Yet this experiment in freedom and diversity, which would survive the revolutionary era, offered a glimpse of the future. Cultural pluralism and an open religious and political order subject to passionate ethnic and social conflicts w'ould characterize much of American society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. irs Chapter 4 Cirowth and Crisis in American Society 1720—1765 The life of the mind came of age in British North America as educated men founded clubs, schools, and publications. The first American newspapers had appeared in Boston in 1704 and Philadelphia in 1719, but their numbers increased dramatically after 1740; by 1765 nearly every colony had a regularly published newspaper. Ambitious printers produced magazines aimed at wealthy gentlemen, including rhe New York, the Massachusetts, and Franklin's General. Although most of them were failures—local newspapers and books from Europe filled the needs of the reading pub- lic—they were the first significant nonreligious publications (apart from newspapers) to appear in the colonies. The European Enlightenment had added a secular dimension to colonial intellectual life, preparing the way for the great American contributions to republican political theory during the Revolutionary' Era. Pietism in America While American deists challenged old religious views, many other Americans embraced the new European devotional movement known as Pietism. Pietism paid little attention to theological dogma, emphasizing instead moral behavior, emotional church services, and a mystical union with God. Pietist preachers appealed to the hearts, nor the minds, of their followers. They exhorted people to be devout—that is, "pious"—Christians; hence the name. Their teachings were particularly popular among the lower orders of European society, and peasants, artisans, and laborers joined pietistic churches by the thousands. Pietism came to America with German migrants in the 1720s and led to a religious revival in the middle colonies. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey rhe Dutch minister Theodore Jacob Frclinghuysen moved from church to church, preaching to German settlers and arousing them with vigorous, emotional sermons. Frel- inghuysen then harnessed their enthusiasm, organizing private prayer meetings and encouraging lay members of the congregation to preach a message of spiritual urgency to growing congregations. William Tennenr and his son Gilbert were Presbyterian clergymen who copied Frelinghuysen's approach and during the 1730s led a series of revivals among Scots-Irish migrants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Simultaneously, an American pietistic movement was born in Puritan New England. Puritanism had been part of an upsurge of piety in sixteenth-century England, but over the years many Puritan congregations had lost their religious zeal. During the 1730s Jonathan Edwards sought to restore spiritual commitment to the Congregational churches of the Connecticut River Valley, urging people—especially young men and women— to commit themselves to a life of piety and prayer (see American Lives, pages 120-121}. George WhiteKeki and the Great Awakening Religious revival was carried to new heights in the 1740s by George Whitefield. a young English evangelist. Whitefieid had experienced conversion in England after reading German pietistic tracts. He became a disciple of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, who himself had been inspired by German Moravian Pietists during a stay in Georgia. Wesley combined enthusiastic preaching with disciplined "methods" of worship. Soon he had persuaded thousands of Anglicans and scores of ministers to become pietistic Methodists within the Church of England. Whitefield preached with equal success in America, where, outside of New England, he found a society' with few ministers and a weak churchgoing tradition. Whitefield established an orphanage in Georgia in 1738 and then returned to preach throughout the colonies from 1739 to 1741. Huge crowds of "enthusiasts" greeted the young preacher wherever he went, from Georgia to Massachusetts. "Religion is become the Subject of most Conversations," the Pennsylvania Gazette reported. "No books are in Request but those of Piety and Devo- tion." The usually skeptical and restrained Benjamin Franklin was so impressed by Whirefield's oratory that when the preacher asked for contributions, Franklin emptied his pockets "wholly into the collector's dish, gold and all." By the time the evangelist reached Boston, the Reverend Benjamin Colman reported that the people were "ready to receive him as an angel of God." Whitefield owed his appeal partly to his compelling personal presence. "He looked almost Angelical—a young, slim, slender youth," according to one Connecticut farmer. And he spoke magnificently and with great force, impressing on his audience that they all had sinned and must seek salvation. Like most evangelical preachers, Whitefield did not read his sermons but spoke from memory, as if inspired, raising his voice for dramatic effect, gesturing eloquently, and making striking use of biblical metaphors. The young preacher evoked a deep emotional response. Hundreds of men and women suddenly felt the "new light" of God's grace within them; strengthened and self-confident, these New Lights were prepared to follow in Whitefield's footsteps. The evangelist's eloquence transformed the local revivals in the Connecticut Valley and the middle colonics into a genuine Great Awakening that spanned the mainland settlements, spreading a set of shared religious values. Henry Melchior Muhlenberg The Paxton Boys March on Philadelphia Racial conflict on the frontier sparked ethnic and religious confrontation in Pennsylvania as armed Scots-lrish Presbyterians marched on Philadelphia. Lutheran Germans opposed many of the policies of the politically dominant (and usually pacifist) Quakers and their German Moravian allies. This jounial entry by the leading Lutheran minister Henry Melchior Muhlenberg mocks the hypocrisy of the Quakers and, in the process, reveals the extent of ethnic antagonism in Pennsylvania. February 5. Toward evening the rumor sprang up that a corps of backwoods settlers—Englishmen, Irishmen, and Germans—were on the march toward Philadelphia to kill the Bethlehem Indians at the barracks outside the city. Some reported that they numbered seven hundred, others said fifteen hundred, etc. The Friends, or so-called Quakers, and the Moravians ran furiously hack and forth to the barracks, and there was a great to-do over constructing several small fortresses or ramparts near the barracks. Cannons were also set up. Some remarked concerning all this that it seemed strange that such preparations should be made against one's own fellow citizens and Christians, whereas no one ever took so much trouble to protect from the Indians His Majesty's subjects and citizens on the frontier. As far as I can learn, the opinion and sentiment of various ones of our German citizens is as follows: That the Quakers and Berhlc- hemites had only used some of the aforesaid Indians as spies and that they had in view only their own selfish interests . .. which explained why the Quakers, etc. in Philadelphia did not exhibit the least evidence of human sympathy, etc. when Germans and other settlers on the frontiers were massacred and destroyed in the most inhuman manner by the Indians. After two o'clock at night the watchmen began to cry, "Fire!" I asked our watchman, who is a member of our congregation, where the fire was. He said there was no fire, but that the watchmen had orders to cry out, "Fire," because the above-men- tioned backwoodsmen were approaching. Thereupon all the alarm hells began to ring at once and a drum was sounded to summon the inhabitants of the city to the town hall plaza. The ringing sounded dreadful in the night. A whole tronp of small boys followed a prominent Quaker down the street shouting in amazement, "Look, look! a Quaker carrying a musket on his shoulder!" Indeed, the older folks also looked upon it as a miraculous portent to see so many old and young Quakers arming themselves with fljnr- locks and daggers, or so-called murderous weapons! What heightened their amazement was rhis: that these pious sheep, who had such a tender conscience during the long Spanish, French, and Indian War, and would rather have died than lift a hand for defense against the most dangerous enemies, were now all of a sudden willing to put on horns of iron like Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah (I Kings 22), and shoot and smite a small group of their poor, oppressed, driven, and suffering fellow inhabitants and citizens from the frontier!

In Anson County, for example, they argued that each person should pay taxes "in proportion to the profits arising from his estate." But the North Carolina insurgents were no more successful than were the other western protesters. In 1771 Governor William Tryon mobilized the militia and defeated a large Regulator force at the Alamance River; seven insurgent leaders were summarily executed. Not since Leisler's 1689 revolt in New York had political conflict in America resulted in so much bloodshed. hi 1771 as in 1689, colonial conflicts became intertwined with imperial politics. In far-off Connecticut, the Reverend Ezra Stiles defended the Regulators. "What shall an injured & oppressed people do," he asked. when they are faced with "Oppression and tyranny {under the name of Government)?" Stiles saw himself as an American patriot, and his condemnation of Governor Tryon in 1771 reflected American resistance to British imperial control. But Stiles's remarks also served as a commentary on developments in the mainland colonies between 1720 and 1765. These were years of crisis—agricultural, religious, ethnic, and military—but also of transformation. In 1765 America was still a dependent society closely tied to Britain by trade, culture, and politics, hut it was also an increasingly complex society with the potential for an independent existence. British policies would determine the direction the maturing colonies would take. Toward Independence, 1775-1783 an independent Provincial Congress; in April that body instructed its representatives "to concur with the Delegates of other Colonies in declaring Independency, and forming foreign alliances." Virginia followed suit, l.ed by George Mason, James Madison, Edmund Pendleton, and Patrick Henry, Patriots called a special convention in May at which they resolved unanimously "to declare the United Colonies free and independent states." Common Sense The break with Britain did not come easily. It was not difficult for Patriots to repudiate Parliament—the author of the hated tax laws—but most Americans retained a deep loyalty to the Crown. Joyous crowds had toasted the health of King George III after the repeal of the Stamp Act, and even as the imperial crisis worsened, Benjamin Franklin proposed that the king rule over autonomous American assemblies. Americans condemned the legislation enacted by Parliament, not the king or the institution of monarchy. The roots of this loyalty ran deep in the structure of American society. Like most men and women in the early modem world, Americans used metaphors of age and family to describe the system of social authority and imperial rule. Colonists often pictured their society as the dependent offspring—the child—of Britain, the "mother country." They respected "elders" in town meetings and church congregations. In their minds, the family was a "little commonwealth" ruled by its male head and the king was the "father" of his people. Denial of the legitimacy of the monarchy threatened paternal authority and the hierarchical order of society. Yet events had prepared Americans to reject their political father. Economic and religious changes had lessened the power and authority of fathers and traditional leaders. And by 1775 zealous Patriots were accusing George III of supporting ministers who passed oppressive legislation and of ordering the use of military force against them. Agitation against the king became especially intense in Philadelphia, the largest American city but not previously a bastion of Patriot sentiment because of the Loyalist sympathies of many of its merchants. Now artisans took the initiative. Constituting about half the city's population, artisans owned nearly 40 percent of its wealth but feared for their future prosperity. Many felt that British imports threatened their small-scale manufacturing enterprises and that Parliament was bent on eliminating their "just Rights and Privileges." After the outbreak of fighting in Massachusetts the artisans, now organized into a Mechanics Association, became a powerful force in the Patriot movement. By February 1776 forty artisans were sitting alongside forty-seven merchants on .the Philadelphia Committee of Resistance, the extralegal body that enforced the latest trade boycott. More than economic self-interest was at work here. Some artisans and more of the city's laborers were Scots-lrish Presbyterians who had migrated to Pennsylvania to escape oppressive British rule in northern Ireland, and many adhered to the doctrine of religious equality propounded by Gilbert Tennent and other New Light ministers. As pastor of Philadelphia's Second Presbyterian Church, Tennent had told his congregation The Royal Family George 111 strikes a regal pose, surrounded by his queen and numerous offspring, all brilliantly attired. Patriots repudiated not only monarchy bur also rhe fancy dress and aristocratic manners of the anciett regime, championing a society of republican simplicity. Chapter 6 War and Revolution 1775—1783 that all men and women are equal before God. Translating religious equality into political terms. New Light Presbyterians shouted in street demonstrations that they had "no king but King Jesus." In addition, republican ideas derived from the European Enlightenment circulated freely in Pennsylvania. Well-educated scientists and statesmen—such as Benjamin Franklin. David Rit- tenhouse, Charles Thomson, and Benjamin Rush— joined artisans in questioning not only the wisdom of George III but also the legitimacy of the monarchy. At this pivotal moment, with popular sentiment in a state of llux, a single pamphlet tipped the balance. In January 1776 Thomas Paine published Common Sense, a call for independence and republicanism. Paine, a corset maker and minor bureaucrat in Britain, had been tired from the English Customs Service for agitating for higher wages. He migrated to Philadelphia in 1774, armed with a letter of introduction from Benjamin Franklin. There he met Benjamin Rush and others who shared his republican sentiments. "Monarchy and hereditary succession have laid the world in blood and ashes," Paine proclaimed in Common Sense, leveling a personal attack against the king, "the hard hearted sullen Pharaoh of England." Mixing insults with biblical quotations, Paine blasted the British system of "mixed government," which yielded only "monarchical tyranny in the person of the King and aristocratical tyranny in the persons of the peers." Paine presented the case for independence in a way that the general public could understand and respond to, suggesting the absurdity of an island ruling or conquering a continent. Common Sense went through twenty-five editions and reached hundreds of thousands of homes. Its message was clear: reject the arbitrary powers of king and Parliament and create independent republican stares. "A government of our own is our natural right," Paine concluded. "'TIS TIME TO part." Independence Declared Fired by Paine's arguments and the escalating military conflict with Loyalists, the American call for a break with Britain sounded with increasing urgency in Patriot conventions throughout the colonies. In June 1776 these disparate demands were given a single voice in the Continental Congress when Richard Henry Lee presented the Virginia Convention's resolution: "That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states . . . absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown." Faced with certain defeat, staunch Loyalists and anti-independence moderates withdrew from the Congress, leaving committed Patriots to take the fateful step. On July 4, 1776, the Congress approved the Declaration of Independence. The main author of the Declaration was Thomas Affirming the Declaration of Independence The mood in the room is solemn as Congress formally declares independence from Great Britain. The delegates were now traitors to their country and king, their fortunes and even their lives hinging on the success of Patriot arms. Jefferson, a young Virginia planrer and legislative leader whose pamphlet A Summary View of the Rights of British America had mobilized resistance to the Coercive Acts. In composing the Declaration, Jefferson primarily wanted to justify Congress's action both to domestic critics and to foreign observers by putting the blame for the rupture on the king. To this end, he enumerated the acts of the imperial government that had oppressed Americans, suggesting that powerful centralized governments are inherently dangerous to liberty. Simultaneously, he provided a detailed indictment of the king's conduct, discrediting monarchical rule. Through the power of his prose, Jefferson sought to convince his fellow Americans of the perfidy of George 111: "He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burned our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. ... A prince, whose character is thus marked by even' act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people," In ringing phrases Jefferson proclaimed a series of "self-evident" truths: "that all men are created equal"; that they possess the "unalienable rights" of "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"; that government derives its "just powers from the consent of the governed" and can rightly be overthrown if it "becomes destructive of these ends." His prose, steeped in the ideas and rhetoric of the European Enlightenment and the Glorious Revolution of 1688, celebrated the doctrines of individual liberty and popular sovereignty. All Americans are heirs of this revolutionary republican tradition. For Jefferson, as for Paine, the pen was mightier than the sword. Almost overnight many halfhearted Americans were radicalized into republican revolution- The Path to Victory, 1778-1783 from circulation, so the value of the remaining bills continued to fall. Indeed, the enormous increase in the volume of paper currency created the worst inflation in American history. The amount of goods available for purchase— both domestic foodstuffs and foreign manufactures— had shrunk significantly because of the fighting and the British naval blockade, even as the amount of currency had multiplied. Inevitably, consumers "bid up" the prices of goods. In Maryland, for example, a bag of salt that had cost $1 in 1776 was valued at $3,900 a few years later. This soaring inflation forced nearly every family to look out for its own interests. Unwilling to accept worthless currency', hard-pressed farmers refused to sell their crops, even to the American army-. To supply their own needs, farmers resorted to barter—trading wheat for tools or clothes—or sold goods only to those who could pay in gold or silver. In towns, women led mobs that seized overpriced sugar, tea, and bread from storekeepers. With civilian morale and social cohesion crumbling despite the victory' at Saratoga, some Patriot leaders began to doubt that the rebellion could succeed. Valley Forge. Fears reached their peak during the winter of 1777-1778. After the capture of Philadelphia, Howe established winter quarters there, and he and his officers partook of the finest wines, foods, and entertainment the city could offer. Washington's army retreated into the Pennsylvania countryside, establishing its base for the winter some 20 miles to the west, in Valley Forge. About 12,000 soldiers, accompanied by hundreds of camp followers, arrived at the camp in December. Everyone suffered horribly. "The army . . . now begins to grow sickly," a surgeon confided to his diary. "Poor food—hard lodging—cold weather—fa- tigue—nasty clothes—nasty cookery. . . . Why are we sent here to starve and freeze?" Many soldiers deserted, unable to endure the harsh conditions; by spring over a thousand men had vanished into the countryside. Another 3,000 soldiers and scores of camp followers died from malnutrition and disease. One winter at Valley Forge took as many American lives as had two years of lighting against General Howe. Precarious public backing for the rebellion also threatened the army, which could not depend on fann- ers for support. Ethnic and religious divisions among Americans who lived near Valley Forge directly affected military operations. For example, most New Light members of the Dutch Reformed Church in nearby New Jersey actively supported the American cause, joining the militia and raiding British encampments, but many Old Lights were Loyalists and fed information and supplies to the British. A number of Quakers and German sectarians in Pennsylvania were pacifists, unwilling to support either side. Self-interest also contributed to the deprivation of Washington's army at Valley Forge. Many farmers hoarded their grain over the winter, hoping to profit from high prices in the spring. Others bullied their way through Patriot roadblocks to Philadelphia, where British quartermasters paid in gold and silver. Even farmers who supported the rebellion could not afford to supply the American army when their labors were rewarded with rapidly depreciating Continental Congress dollars. "Such a dearth of public spirit, and want of public virtue," Washington complained—but to no effect. The suffering at Valley Forge continued, graphic testimony to divided loyalties among the public and the inability of the Congress to raise sufficient revenue. In this dark hour Baron von Steuben, a former Prussian military officer, raised the morale and self- respect of both officers and enlisted men by instituting a standardized system of drill and maneuver at Valley Forge. Von Steuben was one of a handful of foreigners who had volunteered their services to the American cause. His efforts encouraged officers to become more professional in their demeanor and behavior and instilled greater order and discipline in the ranks. Thanks to von Steuben, the smaller Continental army that emerged from Valley Forge in the spring was a much tougher and better disciplined force with a renewed sense of purpose. The Path to Victory, 1778-1783 The Patriots' prospects improved dramatically in 1778, when the United States formed a military alliance with France, the most powerful nation on the European continent. The alliance not only brought the Americans money, troops, and supplies but also changed the cpn- flict from a colonial rebellion to an international war. The French Alliance Negotiating the Treaty. In 1777 Benjamin Franklin and two other diplomats, Arthur Lee and Silas Deane, had begun negotiations for a commercial and military treaty with France. Since 1763 France had been seeking revenge for its defeat in the French and Indian War and its loss of Canada. The French foreign minister, the comte de Vergennes, was a determined opponent of Britain and an early supporter of American independence. In 1776 he persuaded King Louis XVI to extend a secret loan to the rebellious colonies and supply them with gunpowder. When news of the .American victory at Saratoga reached Paris in December !7~7, Vergennes urged the king to approve a formal alliance with the Continental Congress. Franklin and his associates craftily exploited the ri- Chapter 7 The New Political Order 1776-1800 lianccs, ethnicity, or regional concerns, but those groups were poorly organized and usually temporary. The new stare and national constitutions made no provision for parties because their authors assumed that representative institutions adequately expressed the will of the people. As president, Washington had tried to stand above parties, but his continuing support for Hamilton's policies exposed him to partisan attack and influenced his decision not to seek a third term. Jefferson too believed that parties were unnecessary and dangerous. Only Madison accepted the inevitability of political parties, and even he assumed that they would be temporary coalitions that would form around a specific issue and then disappear Born into a world of deferential politics, these leaders underestimated the impact of the revolutionary ideology of popular sovereignty. A politically active citizenry laid the basis for a competitive part)' system. Once political parties appeared, they attracted the long- term allegiance of regional or occupational groups. Merchants and creditors in the northeastern states supported the Federalist party, as did wheat-exporting slaveholders in the Tidewater districts of the Chesapeake states. The Republican coalition was more diverse. By the mid 1790s it included mechanics and artisans in seaport cities, southern tobacco planters, German and Scots-Irish settlers, and subsistence farmers throughout the country. Republican policies appealed to a wider range of social groups, but the Federalists' prestige, wealth, and experience made them a potent political force. In 1796, in an election dominated by conflict over ideology and foreign policy, Federalist candidates triumphed, winning a majority in Congress and in the electoral college. The electors chose John Adams as president. When some Federalist electors refused to vote for Adams's choice for vice-president, Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina (offended by a treaty he had negotiated wirh Spain), Thomas Jefferson, the Republican candidate for president, won the second highest number of electoral votes and, as stipulated in the Constitution, became vice-president. Thus the nation had a divided administration. As chief executive, John Adams upheld the Federalists' pro-British foreign policy. He condemned French seizures of American merchant ships and accused France of meddling in the American domestic affairs. When three agents of Prince Talleyrand, the French foreign minister, solicited a loan and a bribe from American diplomats, Adams urged Congress to prepare for war. To overcome Republican objections, he charged that Talleyrand's agents, whom he dubbed X, Y, and Z, had insulted the honor of the United States. The Feder- alist-controlled Congress cut off trade with France and authorized American privateers to seize French ships. Between 1798 and 1800 the United States became an unofficial ally of Great Rritain—a monarchy and its recent enemy—and fought an undeclared war against France, a republic and its major supporter during the War of Independence. The Crisis of 1798-1800 The Alien and Sedition Acts. For the first—but not the last—time in American history, a controversial foreign war prompted domestic protest and governmental repression. Pro-French immigrants from Ireland viciously attacked Adams's foreign policy in newspapers and pamphlets. To silence them, in 1798 the administration enacted an Alien Act that authorized the deportation of foreigners. A few Federalist supporters favored even harsher treatment. "Were I president, 1 would hang them for otherwise they would murder me," declared a Philadelphia pamphleteer. To allay such exaggerated concerns, the administration passed a Naturalization Act, which increased the residence requirement for citizenship from five to fourteen years. Also in 1798, the Federalist Congress enacted a harsh Sedition Act, prohibiting the publication of ungrounded or malicious attacks against the president or Congress. "He that is not for us is against us," thundered the Federalist Gazette of Am Anti-French Cartoon A five-headed monster, representing the leaders of France under the Directory, demands a bribe ("Money, Money, Money") from American diplomats. Federalists used the incident, named the XYZ affair for the three anonymous French agents who asked for the bribe, to whip up anti-French sentiment in the United States and launch an undeclared naval war. The Political Crisis of the 1790s the United States. Using the legal powers of the new act. Federalist prosecutors arrested more than twenty Republican newspaper editors and politicians, charged them with sedition, and sent some of them to prison. Republicans assailed the Sedition Act as contrary to the Bill of Rights. Because the First Amendment to the Constitution prohibits the national government from "abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,'- the Sedition Act was probably unconstitutional. But Republican leaders did not turn to the Supreme Court for redress. The Court's powers were still vague, particularly with regard to the "judicial review" of Congressional legislation. Besides, the Court was an appointed body packed with Federalists, who would probably have upheld the Sedition Act. Madison and Jefferson instead rook the fight to elected bodies—the state legislatures not dominated by Federalists. In November 1798 the legislature of Ken- tucky—the first western territory to become a stare, in 1792—passed a resolution declaring the Alien and Sedition Acts to be "unaurhoritative, void, and of no force." More important, the resolution asserted that the national government owed its existence to a compact among the states, which meant that "each party has an equal right to judge by itself." The Virginia resolution similarly claimed that the states had the right to refuse to enforce federal laws that exceeded the powers granted by the Constitution. The Kentucky and Virginia resolutions thus laid the theoretical basis for subsequent "states' rights" interpretations of the Constitution. In 1798, as in the ratification conventions in 1788, Federalist assertions of national authority provoked a debate over the nature of the Union. Even Madison— the architect of the Constitution—had second thoughts and argued that the national government had resulted from a compact among rhe states. In the heat of partisan conflict Jefferson also experienced ideological conversion; once opposed in principle to political parties, he now endorsed them as valuable "to watch and relate to the people" the activities of the government. The Election of 1800. The debate over the Sedition Act set the stage for the election of 1800. Republicans supported Jefferson's bid for the presidency' by pointing to the wrongful imprisonment of newspaper editors and championing the rights of the states. President Adams responded to these attacks by reevaluating his foreign policy. Adams was a complicated man, often vain, easily offended, dogmatic, but possessed of great personal strength and determination, l ie showed his quality as a statesman by rejecting the advice of Hamilton and other Federalist leaders to intensify' the undeclared war with France and benefit politically from nationalistic fervor. Instead, he entered into diplomatic negotiations that brought the war to an end. Federalists attempted to win the election by depicting Jefferson as an irresponsible pro-French radical— "rhe archapostle of irreligion and free thought"—but they were unsuccessful. The Republicans won a resounding victory. Voters had registered their protest against a foreign war—and a special national tax on land and houses levied in 1798 to pay for it—by giving Republicans a majority in both houses of Congress and a narrow edge in the electoral college. The electors, however, gave Jefferson and Aaron Burr of New York (Jefferson's choice for vice-president) the same number of votes for the office of president. In the event of such a tie, the Constitution specified that the House of Representatives would select the president, with each state having one vote to cast. (The Twelfth Amendment, ratified in 1804, remedied this constitutional defect by requiring die electors to cast separate ballots for president and vice-president.) Alexander Hamilton played a crucial role in rhe drama that followed. For thirty-five ballots Federalists in the House of Representatives blocked Jefferson's election. Then the former treasury secretary intervened. Calling Burr an "embryo Caesar" and the "most unfit man in the United States for the office of president," Hamilton persuaded key Federalists to permit the selection of Jefferson, his longtime rival. The Federalists' concern for political stability also played a role. As Senator James Bayard of Delaware explained, "It was admitted on all hands that we must risk the Constitution and a Civil War or take Mr. Jefferson." Jefferson called the election the "Revolution of 1800," and so it was. Tt signaled the twilight of Federalism and its aristocratic outlook and the dawn of a more democratic era. The election also testified to the strength of the American experiment in self-govern- ment. Federalists had attacked Republicans as social radicals, traitors, and atheists for nearly a decade, with all sincerity, yet they peacefully relinquished power to their enemies. This bloodless transfer of power was genuinely revolutionary. It demonstrated that governments elected by the people could be changed by the people in an orderly, civilized way even in times of bitter partisan conflict. In his inaugural address in 1801 Jefferson referred to this achievement, declaring: "We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists." He called on Americans to temper the "will of the majority " with respect for the rights of those in the minority, "which equal laws must protect, and to violate would be op- pression." Over the course of a quarter century Jefferson had remained true to his principles. In 1801, as in the Declaration of Independence of 1776, he defined the American republic as a government based on both majority' rule and minority rights, with laws that treated citizens equally and respected their liberty. Chapter S Toward a Continental Nation 1 790-1821) rhe judiciary as a stronghold," Jefferson complained, .. and from that battery all the works of Republicanism are to be beaten down and destroyed." The Republicans fought back. The new Congress repealed the controversial Judiciary Act, dismissing the midnight judges as superfluous. It also used constitutional provisions to punish Federalist judges for their political partisanship on the bench. The Constitution empowered the House of Representatives to bring impeachment charges against officials for ''high crimes and misdemeanors"; the accused was then brought to trial before the Senate. First the House impeached a mentally unstable Federalist judge, John Pickering of New Hampshire, and won his removal from office. Then House Republicans brought impeachment charges against Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in retaliation for his oversea Ions enforcement of the Sedition Act. But enough senators balked at this obviously political move to allow Chase to escape removal by a narrow vote. Jefferson pursued a more conciliatory policy. 1 le supported repeal of the recent Judiciary Act but judged Federalist bureaucrats on the basis of ability, not party loyalty. During eight years as chief executive he removed only 109 of 433 Federalist officeholders, 40 of whom had been midnight appointees of Adams. The "Revolution of 1800." Jefferson was determined to change the character of the national government. The Federalists, he charged, had swollen its size and power; Republicans would shrink it back to its constitutional size and shape. When the Alien and Sedition Acts expired in 1801, Congress did not reenact them, charging that they were politically motivated and unconstitutional. The Naturalization Act was amended to permit resident aliens to become citizens after five years. For his part, Jefferson modified many Federalist policies. During the 1790s Federalist administrations had paid tribute to the Barbary States of North Africa— that is, bribed them to spare American merchant ships from attack in the Mediterranean Sea. Jefferson stopped the payments in 1801, and when the city-states of Tunis, Morocco, Tripoli, and Algiers renewed their assaults, he ordered U.S. naval and marine units to retaliate. Bur Jefferson knew that an extended campaign would require a buildup of the army and navy, which would increase taxes and the national debt. He therefore accepted a diplomatic solution, reviving the Federalist tribute system but, by threatening new military action, at a much lower cost. In domestic affairs, too, Jefferson set his own course—moderate but clearly Republican. He abolished all internal taxes, including the excise tax that had sparked the Whiskey Rebelhon of 1794. Addressing his party's fears of a military takeover of the government, Jefferson reduced the size of the permanent army'. He came to accept the Bank of the United States, which he had condemned as unconstitutional in 1791. because of its importance to rhe nation's economy', but he was still opposed to a large public debt. One of his most important appointments was that of Albert Gallatin, a brilliant Swiss-born Republican, as secretary of rhe treasury. Gallatin was a fiscal conservative who believed that the national debt was "an evil of the first magni- tude." By carefully controlling government expenditures and using customs revenues to redeem government bonds, he reduced the debt from $83 million in 1801 to $45 million in 1808. After the "Revolution of 1800" Jefferson and Gallatin saw to it that rhe nation was no longer run in the interests of northeastern creditors and merchants. Jefferson and the West The main objective of the Jefferson administration was to help the yeomen farm families who were settling the West. Long before his presidency Jefferson had championed western prosperity. He had celebrated the pioneer farmer in Notes on the State of Virginia (1785), helped compose the Confederation's land ordinances, and strongly supported Pinckney's Treaty of 1795, which allowed westerners to ship crops down the Mississippi for export through Spanish-held New Orleans. Now he had the opportunity to shape the nation's land policy. The Northwest Territory. The settlement of the Old Northwest had been carefully planned by rhe Confederation Congress. The ordinances of 1785 and 1787, which had created the Northwest Territory, had divided it into uniform sections or townships. Townships were about the same size as New England communities, 6 miles square, and were divided into thirty-six sections of 1 square mile, or 640 acres, surveyed in a grid pattern (see Map 8.2). Despite Jefferson's efforts, the ordinance of 1785 had a class bias, favoring speculators over yeomen. It specified a minimum price of $1 per acre and required that half the townships be sold in single blocks of 23,040 acres eqch, making direct purchase impossible for all but the wealthy. The other half of the townships were divided into parcels of 640 acres. But even this was too expensive for many migrants; only well-to-do farmers could afford the $640 cash price for an ordinary' farmstead, not to mention the considerably higher amount needed to buy high-quality or well-placed land. Poorer migrants demanded better terms, but the Feder- alist-dominated Congresses of the 1790s turned a deal ear. Many Federalist politicians were eastern landlords and had no desire to lose their tenants to cheap land in the West. In fact, the Federalist Land Act of 1796 doubled the minimum price to $2 per acre. Much of the best land fell into the hands of speculators, such as those in the Ohio and Scioto land companies, as the authors of the ordinances had intended. Chapters Toward a Continental Nation 1"90-I820 The decline of the federalists prompted contemporary observers to call the two terms of President James Monroe, from 1817 to IS25, the Fra of Good Feeling. Actually, national political harmony was more apparent than real, for the dominant Republican parry—now home to many former federalists-—split into factions that struggled over power and patronage, and, after 1820, economic policy. Regional Diversity and National Identity The political divisions manifested during the War of 1812 showed that regional differences were stronger than ever. There were four American cultures—New England, Middle Atlantic, Chesapeake, and Lower South—each with distinctive values and political interests (see Map 8.4). As migrants transplanted those cultures to the Old Northwest and Old Southwest, American life became even more diverse, divided between complex seaboard societies and frontier farming regions. To unify this increasingly fragmented society, politicians and statesmen defined a new national goal: a continental American empire. Northern Seaboard Societies Generations of observers had contrasted the race- and class-divided societies of the Chesapeake with the freehold farming regions of the North, particularly New England. Popular speech reflected some of these differences: "Yankee," a foreign traveler learned, was "a name given derisively, or merely jestingly," to the residents of New England because of their shrewd bargaining habits. "The name of 'Buckskin' is given to the inhabitants of Virginia," he went on to observe, "be- cause their ancestors were hunters and sold buck, or rather deer skins." European visitors saw genuine cultural differences in the popular stereotypes. In 1800 a British observer detected religious "fanaticism" in New England as well Regional Cultures Move West. 1720-1820 By 1720 four distinct "core" cultures had developed along tlie Atlantic seaboard. By 1775 setters from the mid-Atlantic and Chesapeake regions had carried their customs and institutions into the southern backcountry. Then, between 1780 and 1820, settlers from New England and the Lower South transplanted their regional cultures into other parts of the trans-Appalachian West. Extensive cultural intermixture—and conflict—occurred only in certain regions, such as southern Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Regional Diversity and National Identity as "a great srrain of industry among all ranks of peo- ple." He thought that "the lower orders of citizens have a better education, arc more intelligent, and better informed" than those he met in the southern states. Visitors to the Chesapeake commented on the rude manners and heavy drinking of white tenant farmers and small freeholders. They had a "passion for gaming at the billiard table, a cock-fight or cards." New Englanders did indeed set a higher store by education than did residents of the Chesapeake. The Puritan legacy included strong traditions of primary schooling and Bible reading. As a result, most of the men and more than half the women in New England in 1790 could read and write. In Virginia, most white women and a third of adult white men could not even write their names; they signed legal documents such as wills and marriage licenses with an "X" or another mark. This disparity in the literacy rate reflected different social and fiscal priorities. The slaveholding elite that ruled southern society refused to provide services or schooling for ordinary white families. In 1800 the 4,000 free inhabitants of Essex County in Virginia spent about S 1,000 for local government, including schooling. The same year the 900 residents of Acton, Massachusetts, spent $950 for public purposes—four rimes as much per capita as in Essex County—$550 on education alone. Regional differences were also apparent in the observance of holidays. In Virginia. South Carolina, and other states with an Anglican heritage, Christmas was an occasion for feasting and celebration. Not so in New England, where Puritans condemned such celebrations as profane. Most New England churches did not celebrate Christmas until the 1850s; for them. Thanksgiving Day, commemorating the trials and triumphs of the first Pilgrim and Puritan settlers, was the focus of celebration. During the War of Independence New England customs had become political symbols as Congress frequently declared days of fasting and thanksgiving. Regional identity was especially intense in New England because of ethnic and religious uniformity. By the 1820s most men and women in the region could trace their American roots back six or seven generations. No fewer than 281 members of the Newhall family resided in Lynn, Massachusetts, along with 259 Breeds, 195 Alleys, and 162 Johnsons. A list of only twelve family names encompassed 1,660 persons, or 27 percent of the town's population. In a very real sense New England was a "big family" composed of large, interrelated groups. The culture of the Middle Atlantic region was more diverse, because the people came from different ethnic backgrounds. In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Quakers, Germans, and Scots-Irish married largely within their own ethnic groups, and to a lesser extent so did the Dutch. Germans held on to their language as well as Puritan Culture Persists Like good Puritans, this prosperous New England couple wear plainly cut clothes and hold the symbols of piety and literacy—a book and a pen. The artist shows his stepmother looking directly at him (and us), suggesting that he enjoyed a better relationship with her than with his stern-faced father, a traditional New England patriarch. their customs, especially in the small agricultural villages of Pennsylvania and the isolated backcountry districts of Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. A visitor to Hanover, Maryland, noted around 1820, "The inhabitants are all German. Habits, speech, newspapers, cooking—all German." hi nearby Frederick Town the Lutheran church kept all its records and held Sunday-school classes in German. This diversity among and within the various regions inhibited the establishment of an American national identity. Until the growth of interregional commerce created a national economy (see Chapter 9), only certain political events—such as the War of 1812—re- minded people that they were citizens of the United States. For example, the term "Uncle Sam" came into use during the War of 1812. "This cant name for our government has got almost as common as John Bull [for the British)," a newspaper in Troy, New York, reported: "The letters U.S. on government waggons fee are supposed to have given rise to it."

Newspapers played an increasingly important role in fostering national identity and common cultural values. By 1820 the cities of the United States boasted thirty daily newspapers. Another thousand newspapers, mostly four-page weeklies, provided national news, market information, and advertisements to people in small towns and rural areas. Political parties subsidized some of these newspapers, creating a national debate on various legislative issues. The influential Niles Weekly Register; established in Baltimore in 1811, and the North American Review, founded in Boston in 1815, carried news from Europe and the East to every region. But only members of certain elites—merchants, politicians, lawyers—participated fully in this national culture. Most Americans lived our their lives within the regional culture into which they had been born. The Old Northwest When Jedidiah Morse published American Geography in 1793, he listed three "grand divisions of the United States": northern, middle, and southern. In the edition of 1819 he added a new section: "Western States and Territories." Some seventy years later, in an essay called "The Significance of the Frontier in American History" (1893), the historian Frederick Jackson Turner placed the West at the center of the American experience. Turner argued that an identifiable national character first developed in the West because that area was controlled by the national government. He also maintained that the western frontier experience itself—the life-or- death struggle with nature—created a character and a System of values that were distinctly American: individualistic, optimistic, pragmatic, and democratic. Turner's theories provoked a generation of scholarly research and debate, but historians no longer accept many of his views. For instance, Turner underestimated the force of cultural tradition. Most migrants to the West, like most Europeans who came to America, sought to preserve their old values and customs. Thus, when 176 residents of Granville, Massachusetts, decided to move to Ohio, they carefully chose a site whose "peculiar blending of hill and valley" resembled the landscape of their New England community. They transplanted their Congregational church to Ohio whole, complete with ministers and elders, along with their system of freehold agriculture. So it was throughout the trans-Appalachian West: in many respects "new" communities were not new—they were old communities that had moved inland. Yet Turner was right about the self-sufficiency of the majority of frontier communities. Cut off from most trade with outside markets, settlers made their own clothes, repaired old tools, and lived in a local barter economy, exchanging goods or labor with their neighbors. "A noble held of Indian corn stretched away into the forest on one side," an English visitor to an Ohio farm in the 1820s noted, waxing romantic, and immediately before the house was a small potato garden, with a few peach and apple trees. The woman told me that they spun and wove all the cotton and woollen garments of the family, and knit all the stockings; her husband, though not a shoemaker by trade, made all the shoes. She manufactured all the soap and candles they use. All she wanted with money, she said, was to buy coffee, tea, and whiskey, and she could "get enough any day by sending a batch of butter and chickens to market." A low standard of living prevailed for this and other farm families for more than a generation. As late as 1840, per capita income in the Old Northwest was only 70 percent of the national average. Regional Diversity ant! National Identity Apart from its relative poverty, the distinctiveness of the region lay in the conflict among competing cultural traditions. In Indiana, education-conscious migrants from New England set up a system of public- primary schools, but only after a twenty-year battle with tax-shy yeomen from the southern states. Although the New England influence was strong, the states of the Old Northwest developed largely along the model of the Middle Atlantic states—Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York—with their diverse cultural traditions and ethnic political factions. Slavery Moves into the Old Southwest As poor whites fled from the Chesapeake states to Kentucky and Tennessee, wealthy planters and up-and- coming young men from the Chesapeake and the Lower South set up new slave plantations in the Old South- west—the future states of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Consequently, the southwestern frontier became a stronghold not of Turner's individualism and democracy but of slavery. Indeed, slavery expanded in newly settled areas. As planters from the Lower South states of Georgia and South Carolina moved into the backcountry, they imported new slaves from Africa. They had used their influence at the Philadelphia convention of 1787 to protect this trade from national regulation for twenty years, and when the time limit expired in 1808, Congress responded to antislavery settlement in the North by banning American participation in the transatlantic slave trade. But by that time 250,000 new slaves had entered the United States, a number equal to that of all slaves imported during the colonial period. The black population had also grown through reproduction, increasing from half a million in 1775 to 1.8 million in 1820. Many of these Africans and African-Americans still toiled on tobacco and rice plantations. When soil exhaustion caused tobacco production to stagnate in the Tidewater region of the Chesapeake, white planters took the crop into the Virginia Piedmont, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The rice industry of South Carolina and Georgia expanded until the 1820s, when many of its overseas markets were lost to cheaper rice imports from Asia. By that time white planters in Louisiana—some of rhem refugees from black- controlled Haiti—had established a booming economy based on sugar. Slaves in Louisiana, like those on the sugar plantations of the West Indies, were brutally exploited and died quickly from disease and overwork. The Coming of Cotton. However, it was a new crop— cotton—that provided the impetus for the expansion of slavery. For centuries most Europeans had worn clothing made from wool or flax; cotton textiles imported from India were only for the rich. Cotton spinning and weaving had been taken up in England but had remained a minor industry. Then, after 1750, the European population explosion increased the demand for woolen and cotton cloth just as the technological breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution were boosting production and lowering prices. Soon consumer demand and the newly invented water-powered spinning jennies and weaving mules generated a seemingly insatiable demand for raw- cotton. Beginning in the 1780s, American planters responded to this demand by importing a rot-resistant, smooth-seed, long-fiber variety of cotton from the West Indies and planting it on sea islands along the southern Atlantic coast. Then, in the 1790s, a number of inven- tors—including Connecticut-born Eli Whitney—devel- oped machines to separate the seeds from the fiber of short-staple cotton, which grew' w'ell in many regions of the South. The combination of British demand and American innovation created a new agricultural industry- and a massive demand for land and labor. Thousands of white planters moved into the interior of South Carolina and Georgia to grow cotton. After the War of 1812, production spread into Alabama and Mississippi, which entered the Union in 1817 and 1819, respectively. In a single year a government land office in Huntsville, Alabama, sold $7 million of uncleared land. The expression "doing a land-office business"-—a metaphor for rapid commercial expansion—dates from this time. Cotton's Impact on African-Americans. For enslaved blacks the coming of cotton meant social upheaval. Fin- tire black communities were uprooted from the Chesapeake and Lower South and forced to move west with their owners; even more wrencbingly, thousands of young women and men were taken away from their families through a new domestic slave trade. By 1820 whites had displaced more than 250,000 African- Americans from their birthplaces to new tobacco regions ami the booming cotton states. The history of the Tayloe family's Mount Airy plantation in Virginia illustrates the impact of cotton on the lives of blacks. In 1747 John Tayloe owned 167 slaves at Mount Airy. Over the next sixty years twice as many slaves were born as died on this plantation, creating a large, interrelated African-American community—and, from the lay Iocs' point of view, a "surplus" of workers. Hence, in 1792 John Tayloe 111 advertised a sale of 200 slaves, at least 50 of whom were from Mount Airy. Between 1828 and 1860 Tayloe and his sons would move 180 Mount Airy slaves to their new cotton plantations in Alabama. These sales and forced migrations brought great wealth to a few white families and untold misery to blacks. Torn from their loved ones, African-Americans Chapter H Toward a Continental Nation 1790-1820 The Internal Slave Trade Mounted whites escort a convoy of slaves from Virginia to Tennessee in Louis Miller's Slave Trader, Sold to Tennessee.

"I am Sold to a man by the name of Peterson a trader," lamented one Georgia slave. "My Dear wife for you and my Children my pen cannot Express the grille 1 feel to be parted from you all." Antislavcry Efforts and the Missouri Compromise. The expansion of slavery into the Old Southwest dashed the hopes of those who thought slavery would "die a natural death" after the decline of the tobacco economy and the end of the Atlantic slave trade. Some antislavery advocates had worked to prevent the illegal importation of enslaved Africans. Others had persuaded the legislatures of northern states to pass personal liberty laws protecting free blacks from kidnapping or seizure under the terms of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. More important, reformers had opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories. Despite their efforts, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama joined the Union with stare constitutions permitting slavery. When Missouri applied for admission on a similar basis in IN19, the antislavery forces rallied. Congressman James Tallmadge of New York proposed a ban on the importation of slaves into Missouri and the gradual emancipation of its black inhabitants. When Missouri whites rejected those conditions, the northern majority" in the Elouse of Representatives blocked the territory's admis sion to the Union. In response, southerners used their power in the Senate, which was equally divided between eleven free and eleven slave states, to withhold statehood from Maine, which was seeking to separate itself from Massachusetts. Tempers flared in the heat of debate. Senator Thomas W. Cobb of Georgia accused Tall- madge of kindling "a fire which all the waters of the ocean cannot put out and which seas of blood can only extinguish." Controversy raged for two years before Congress resolved the stalemate. Representative Henry Clay of Kentucky and other skilled politicians put together a series of agreements known collectively as the Missouri Compromise, by which Maine entered the Union as a Regional Diversity and National Identity The Missouri Compromise, 1820 The Missouri Compromise resolved for a generation the issue of slavery in the lands of the Louisiana Purchase. Slavery was forbidden north of the Missouri Compromise line (56° 50' north latitude), with the exception of the state of Missouri. To maintain an equal number of free and slave stares in the U.S. Senate, the compromise provided for the nearly simultaneous admission of Maine and Missouri. free state in 1820 and Missouri was admitted as a slave state the following year (see Map 8.5). This bargain preserved the existing sectional balance in the Senate and set a precedent for the future admission of states in pairs—one free and one slave. To mollify antislavery sentiment in the House of Representatives, southern congressmen accepted the restriction of slavery in the rest of the Louisiana Territory north of latitude 36° 30', the southern boundary of Missouri. The tradition of political compromise on the issue of slavery thus continued. In 1821 as in 1787, the white leaders of the North and the South gave priority to the Union, finding complex but workable ways to reconcile the interests of their regions. But the task had become more difficult. The Philadelphia delegates had resolved their sectional differences in two months; Congress took two years to work out the Missouri Compromise, and there was no guarantee that it would work. The fates of the West, the Union, and the black race had become inextricably intertwined, raising the prospect of civil war. As Thomas Jefferson exclaimed at the time of the Missouri controversy, "This momentous question, like a fire-bell in the night, awakened and filled me with terror." African-American Society and Culture After 1800 a more unified African-American culture began to develop in the United States for three reasons. First, the end of the transatlantic slave trade in 1808 eliminated the need to assimilate newly arrived Africans. F.ven in South Carolina, only about 20 percent of the enslaved population in 1820 had been born in Africa. Second, the movement of slavery into the Old Southwest reduced differences among slaves; for example, the black Gullah dialect of the Carolinas disappeared on the cotton plantations of Alabama and Mississippi because slaves from the Chesapeake had adopted English. Third, free blacks, especially in northern cities, consciously began to foster a sense of a distinct African-American culture. Many African elements persisted in the new African-American culture. About half the slaves who entered the United Stares between 1800 and 1808 came from the Congo and Angola, making those regions important sources of African influences. As the traveler Isaac Holmes reported in 1821: In Louisiana, and the stare of Mississippi, the slaves ... dance for several hours during Sunday afternoon. The general movement is in what they call the Congo dance; their music often consists of nothing more than an excavated piece of wood . . . one end of which is a piece of parchment. Similar descriptions of blacks who "danced the Congo and sang a purely African song to the accompaniment of ... a drum made by stretching a skin over a flour barrell" appeared as late as 1890. Marriage and Family Life. African-Americans also maintained some of the social rules of their West Chapter H Toward a Continental Nation 1790-1820 African-American Banjos In 1794 an Englishman in Virginia watched slaves dancing to the music of an African-style banjo "made of a gourd something in the imitation of a Guitar, with only four strings and played with the fingers in the same manner." African homeland, such as rigid incest taboos. Unlike the white elite of South Carolina, which practiced cousin marriage to keep property in the family and maintain an intermarried ruling group, enslaved blacks shunned marriages between cousins even on relatively self-contained plantations. For example, on the Good Hope plantation in South Carolina about 175 slave children were born between 1800 and 1857, and no fewer than 40 percent of those children were related by blood to three slaves from Africa. Within this elaborate tangle of kinship, only one marriage between cousins took place. Masters and slaves also had different ideas about the sanctity of marriage. Whites insisted on legally binding marriage contracts among themselves both to regulate sexual behavior and to establish the ownership of property. Bur slaveowners forbade legal marriage between blacks so that they could sell their slaves without breaking a marriage bond. Enslaved African-Americans therefore devised their own marriage rituals. Young men and women first asked their parents' consent to marry and then sought their owner's permission to live together in their own cabin. Following African custom, many couples signified their union in a public ceremony by jumping over a broomstick together. Christian blacks often had a religious service performed by a white or black preacher, but these rites never ended with the customary phrase "until death do you part." Everyone knew' that black marriages could end with the sale of one or both of the spouses. Many married slaves who were not separated by sale lived in stable unions. Among the slaves on the Good Hope plantation in South Carolina, about 70 percent of the women had all their children by the same man. Most other women had their first child (with an enslaved man) before marriage in what the community called an "out- side" birth and bore the rest of their children within a stable union. On plantations in Louisiana black family ties were much more fragile, in part because labor in the sugar fields killed many men. Thirty' percent of the slave women on one Louisiana plantation lived alone with their children, who were fathered by a succession of men. Thus, the oppressive conditions of slavery' only partially undermined blacks' efforts to create solid family bonds. To maintain their identity, many recently imported slaves in South Carolina and Georgia bestowed African names on their children; males born on Friday were often called Cuffee—the name of that day in several West African languages. Most Chesapeake slaves chose names of British origin and bound one generation to another by naming sons after fathers, uncles, or grandfathers; daughters were often named after grandmothers. Names had great social importance, for they acknowledged the biological ties of kinship (see Table 8.1). Like incest rules and marriage rituals, naming patterns created order in a harsh and arbitrary world. As an African-American cultural community developed, the quality of slave life gradually improved. During the eighteenth century a lack of social organization among African-born slaves resulting from their diverse origins had made it easy for white men to take advantage of blacks. They had raped women and punished defiant men in horrible ways, branding them, or cutting off their fingers or ears, or even castrating them. Such abuses did nor stop after 1800, but they were questioned more often. White politicians condemned rape as an aristocratic vice that w'as ill suited to life in a republican society. The spread of evangelical Christianity encouraged many masters to treat their slaves more humanely. African-Americans also put themselves in a position to resist the worst forms of oppression by forming stable families and strong communities. They insisted that work gangs be sold "in families" and de- Regional Diversity and Natiomil Identity African-American Naming Patterns Good Hope Plantation Slaves, Orangebury, South Carolina Date of Birth Baby's Name Parents' Names Source of Baby's Name 1793 Hector Bess, Hector Father 1806 Clarinda Patty, Primus Mother's mother 1811 Sambo Affy, Jacob Mother's father 1813 Primus Party, Primus Father 1824 Sarah Phoebe, Jack Mother's mother 1828 Major Clarinda, Abram Father's father tied their owners when they were not. Faced with transport to Mississippi and separation from his wife, one Maryland slave, his owner reported, "neither yields consent to accompany my people, or to he exchanged or sold." Masters ignored such resistance at their risk. They now faced the prospect that a slave's relatives might retaliate for violence or arbitrary sale with arson, poison, or destruction of crops or equipment. Work and Community. Blacks in the rice-growing lowlands of South Carolina were particularly successful in gaining control over their work lives. By the Revolutionary Era those slaves had won the right to labor by the tusli. Each day a worker had to complete a precisely defined task—turn up a quarter acre of rice land, hoe a half acre, or pound seven mortars of rice. Many slaves finished their task "by' one or two o'clock in the after- noon," a Methodist preacher reported. They had "the rest of the day for themselves, which they spend in working their own private fields, consisting of 5 or 6 acres of ground . . . planting rice, corn, potatoes, tobacco &c. for their own use and profit." African- Americans extended these customary rights during the War of Independence, as black drivers took over the management of many plantations, and jealously guarded them afterward. "Should any owner increase the work beyond what is customary," a South Carolina rice planter warned around 1800, "he subjects himself ... to such discontent amongst his slaves as to make them of little use to him." Still, white masters had virtually unlimited power— both legal and physical—over their slaves. In upland cotton-growing regions of South Carolina and Georgia and in Alabama and Mississippi, owners forced workers to labor in supervised "gangs." They sold those who were recalcitrant and punished those they viewed as lazy. Particularly on newly settled plantations, profit- conscious masters used the lash to extract labor. Enslaved blacks found ways to resist the tyranny of slavery. Some, such as Gabriel Prosser of Virginia, plotted mass uprisings and murders. Denmark Vesey, a free black married to a slave woman, planned a rebellion in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1822, but. Like Prosser's, it was discovered and crushed at the last moment. Most blacks knew that a successful revolt was highly unlikely because of white strength in numbers and military superiority. Flight was also perilous. The northern and western states were hotbeds of racial prejudice, and masters could use the Fugitive Slave Law (1793) to carry them back to bondage. Yet hundreds of Chesapeake slaves fled to the free states, and thousands more threatened to do so, forcing their masters to treat them better. Enslaved blacks in the Lower South and Old Southwest had fewer options. One avenue of escape—to Spanish Florida—was cut off in 1819 when the United States annexed Florida. Slaves had no option but to build the best possible lives for themselves where they were. As the black abolitionist Frederick Douglass would observe, these slave communities were "pegged down to a single spot" and "must take root there-or nowhere." Enslaved blacks developed a culture similar to that of European peasants. They worked as dependent agricultural laborers and built close-knit communities based on family, kinship, and religion. Meanwhile, the relatively small population of free African-Americans (about 5 percent of the total by 1820) explored the dimensions of its newfound liberty. The great majority lived on low wages from menial jobs as farm workers or city laborers and laundresses, and their lives were circumscribed by racial prejudice. But a few blacks were able to make full use of their talents and achieved great distinction. The mathematician and surveyor Benjamin Bannaker published an almanac and helped lay out the new national capital; Phyllis Wheat- ley won praise for her poetry, as did Joshua Johnston for his portraiture; and Robert Sheridan acquired a small fortune from his mercantile enterprises. But even more impressive and enduring were the institutions created by this first generation of free African-Americans (see American Lives, pages 254-255). Hundreds of Richard Allen and African-American Identity Richard Allen was a success. Born into slavery in Philadelphia in 1760, he died in 1831 not only free but influential, a founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church and its first bishop. Allen's rise has much of the classic American success story about it, but he bears a larger significance: Allen, as one of the first African- Americans to be emancipated during the Revolutionary Era. had to forge an identity for his people as well as for himself. Sold as a child along with his family to a farmer in Delaware, Allen began his ascent in 1777, when he was converted to Methodism by Freeborn Garretson, an itinerant preacher. Garretson also converted Allen's master and convinced him that on Judgment Day slaveholders would be "weighted in the balance, and ... found want- ing." Allowed by his repentant owner to buy his freedom. Allen earned a living sawing cordwood and driving a wagon during the Revolutionary War. After the war he furthered the Methodist cause by becoming a "licensed exhorter," preaching to blacks and whites from New York to South Carolina. His efforts attracted the attention of Methodist leaders, including Francis Asbury, the first American bishop of the Methodist Church. In 1786 Allen was appointed as an assistant minister in Philadelphia, serving the racially mixed congregation of St. George's Methodist Church. The following year he and Absalom Jones, another black preacher, joined other ex- slaves and Quaker philanthropists to form the Free African Society, a quasi religious benevolent organization that offered fellowship and mutual aid to "free Africans and their descendants." Allen remained a staunch Methodist throughout his life. In 1789, when the Free African Society adopted various Quaker practices, such as having fifteen minutes of silence at its meetings, Allen led a withdrawal of those who preferred more enthusiastic Methodist practices, In 1794 he rejected an offer to become the pastor of the church the Free African Society had built, St. Thomas's African Episcopal Church, a position ultimately accepted by Absalom Jones. A large majority of the society had chosen to affiliate with the white Episcopal (formerly Anglican) Church because much of the city's black community had been Anglican since the 1740s. "I informed them that I could not be anything else but a Methodist, as I was born and awakened under them," Allen recalled. To reconcile his faith and his African-American identity, Allen decided to form his own congregation. He gathered a group of ten black Methodists and took over a blacksmith's shop in the increasingly black southern section of the city, converting it to the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Although the Bethel Church opened in a ceremony led by Bishop Francis Asbury in July 1794, its tiny congregation worshiped "separate from our white brethren." Allen's decision to found a black congregation was partly a response to white racism. Although most white Methodists in the 1790s favored emancipation, they did not treat free blacks as equals. They refused to allow African-Americans to be buried in the congreganon's cemetery and, in a famous incident in 1792, segregated them into a newly built gallery of St. George's Methodist Church. But Allen's action also reflected a desire among African-Americans to control their religious lives, to have the power, for example, "to call any brother that appears to us adequate to the task to preach or exhort as a local preacher, without the interference of the Conference." By 1795 the congregation of Allen's Bethel Church numbered 121; a decade later if had grown to 457, and by 1813 it had reached 1,272. Bethel's rapid expansion reflected the growth of Philadelphia's black population, which numbered nearly 10,000 by 1810, and the appeal of Methodist practices. Newly freed blacks welcomed "love feasts," which allowed the full expression of emotions repressed under slavery. They were attracted as well by the church's strict system of discipline—its communal sanctions against drinking, gambling, and infidelity—which helped them bring order to their lives. Allen's preaching also played a role; the excellence of his sermons was recognized in 1799, when Bishop Asbury ordained him as the first black deacon of the Methodist Church. But over the years Allen and other blacks grew dissatisfied with Methodism, as white ministers retreated from their antislavery principles and attempted to curb the autonomy of African-American congregations. In 1807 the Bethel Church added an "African Supplement" to its articles of incorporation; in 1816 it won legal recognition as an independent church. In the same year Allen and representatives from four other black Methodist congregations (in Baltimore; Wilmington, Delaware; Salem, New Jersey; and Attleboro, Pennsylvania) met at the Bethel Church to organize a new denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Allen was chosen as the first bishop of the church, the first fully independent black denomination in America. He had succeeded in charting a separate religious identity for African-Americans. Allen also recognized the importance of education to the future of the African-American community. In 1795 he opened a day school for sixty children and in 1804 founded the "Society of Free People of Colour for Promoting the Instruction and School Education of Children of African Descent." By 1811 there were no fewer than eleven black schools in the city. But where did Allen think "free people of colour" should look for their future? This question had arisen in Philadelphia in 1787, when William Thornton had promoted a plan devised by antislavery groups in London to settle free American blacks (and emancipated slaves I from the West Indies) in Sierra Leone, an independent I state they had founded on the west coast of Africa. Many blacks in Boston and Newport had endorsed this scheme, but the members of Philadelphia's Free African Society had rejected it. They preferred to seek advancement in America, but on their own cultural terms. The process took place on two levels: as a social group, Philadelphia blacks embraced their ancestral heritage by forming "African" churches and benevolent societies. As individuals, however, they affirmed their American identity by taking English names (although virtually never those of their former owners). This dual strategy brought pride but not significant gains in wealth and status. Nonetheless, Philadelphia's African- Americans rejected colonization; when the issue was raised again just after 1800, only four people signed up for emigration to Sierra Leone. Instead, the city's black community petitioned the state and national governments to end slavery and the slave trade and repeal the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, which allowed slaveowners to seize blacks without a warrant. As if to underline the importance of these political initiatives, Allen was temporarily seized in 1806 as a fugitive slave, showing that even the most prominent northern blacks could nor be sure of their freedom. This experience may account for Allen's initial support for the American Colonization Society, a predominantly white organization founded in 1817 to promote the settlement of free blacks in Africa. This scheme was immediately condemned at a mass meeting of nearly 3,000 Philadelphia blacks, who set forth a different vision of the African-American future: "Whereas our ancestors (not of choice) were the first successful cultivators of the wilds of America, we their descendants feel ourselves entitled to participate in the blessings of her luxuriant soil." Philadelphia's black community, including Allen, was more favorably inclined toward the Haitian Emigration Society, which was founded in 1824 to help African-Americans settle in that island republic. But when that venture failed, Allen forcefully urged blacks to remain in the United States. In November 1827 he made a compelling argument in Freedom's Journal, the nation's first black newspaper; "This land which we have watered with our tears and our blood is now our mother country." Born a slave of African ancestry, Allen learned to live as a free man in white America, rejecting emigration and preserving his cultural identity by creating separate African-American institutions. But it meant that he cast his lot, and that of his descendants, with a society pervaded by racism. It was a brave decision, both characteristic of the man who made it and indicative of the limited choices available to those freed from the bonds of slavery. Chapter 8 Toward a Continental Nation 1790-1X20 them joined together to found black schools, mutual- benefit and fellowship societies, antislavery organizations, and religious denominations. Over the years these institutions helped create a sense of cultural autonomy among African-Americans and gave public expression to their Jives and values. African-American Religion. After the family, the religious community played the most important role in lives of enslaved African-Americans. Many blacks maintained African practices, invoking traditional spirits in time of need. In Louisiana, some slaves from Haiti practiced the folk religion of voodoo, a blend of African and Catholic customs. Many enslaved African- Americans in the Chesapeake became Christians, absorbing and adapting the religious views of white Baptists and Methodists. As black ministers preached or founded churches (which often met in secret to avoid repression), they advanced their own interpretation of Christian doctrines. Black theology generally ignored the issues of original sin and predestination. It also downplayed biblical passages in which the church is viewed as lawgiver and symbol of authority. Black Christians preferred to envision God as a warrior who had liberated his chosen people. "Their cause was similar to the Israelites'," Martin Prosser (Gabriel's brother) told his fellow slave conspirators during the thwarted rebellion in Virginia in 1800. "1 have read in my Bible where God says, if we worship him, we should have peace in all our land and five of you shall conquer a hundred and a hundred of you a hundred thousand of our enemies." The Christian message valued spiritual endurance as well as physical resistance. Some slaves identified with the persecuted Christ, who had suffered and died so that his followers might find peace and justice in the next world. Amid the manifest injustice of their lives, these African-Americans used Christian principles to affirm their equality with whites in the eyes of God. They took the language and religion of their masters but adapted them for their own ends. Trapped in a hicul- tural world, these African-Americans learned from whites but lived as blacks. The Fate of Native Americans "Next to the case of the black race within our bosom," James Madison remarked as he left the presidency in 1817, "that of the red race on our borders is the problem most baffling to the policy of our country." Most American political leaders had fewer misgivings than Madison did. They wanted to open lands in the trans- Appalachian West, regardless of the cost to the native American inhabitants. "Cut up every Indian Cornfield and burn every Indian town," proclaimed William Henry Drayton of South Carolina, so that their "nation be extirpated and the lands become the property of the public." For many educated whites the conquest of the interior and its aboriginal inhabitants represented the historical progress of humanity in which primitive life would be replaced by higher cultural forms. As a congressional committee put it in 1818, "Those sons of the forest should be moralized or exterminated." Cultural Assimilation, circa 1805 Merchant Benjamin Hawkins points to a plow, encouraging Creek Indians to adopt F.uropean farming techniques. By this time the Creeks were bartering corn and other crops (as well as furs) for manufactured goods. Red Jacket A Seneca Chief's Understanding of Religion The Seneca chief Red jacket (c. 1758- 1850) acquired his name during the Revolutionary War, when he fought for the British "redcoats." Reconciling himself to American rule, he joined an Indian delegation that met George Washington. He rejected Christianity, however, and in 1805 he explained why to a group of missionaries, whom he addresses as "Brother." Brother: Continue to listen. You say that you are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind; and, if we do not rake hold of the religion which you white people reach, we shall be unhappy hereafter. You say that you are right, and we are lost. How do we know this to be true? We understand that your religion is written in a book. If it was intended for us as well as you, why has not the Great Spirit given to us, and not only to us, but why did He not give to our forefathers, the knowledge of the book, with the means of understanding it rightly? Brother: The Great Spirit has made us all, but he has made a great difference between his white and red children. He has given us different complexions and different customs. To you He has given the arts [i.e., manu- facturing). To these He has not opened our eyes. We know these tilings to be true. Since He has made a great difference between us in other things, why- may we not conclude that He has given us different religion according to our understanding? The Great Spirit does right. He knows what is best for his children; we are satisfied. Source: David J. Rothman and Sheila Rothman, cds.. Sources of the American Social Tradition (Nov York: Basie Books, 1975). Attempts at Assimilation. In the name of "civilization," government officials sought to destroy the traditional cultural practices of native Americans. Henry Knox, Washington's first secretary of war, had advocated breaking up commonly owned tribal lands and distributing farming plots to individual Indian families as private property, a concept alien to the Indians, who did not own wealth as individuals hut circulated goods to fulfill social obligations. Thomas Jefferson was also an assimilationist, hoping that Americans would "form one people" as Indians would "mix with us by mar- riage." To this end, white leaders demanded that Indians abandon tribal governments and submit to the authority of the state and the nation. Public officials also encouraged the efforts of missionaries to change the Indians' religious beliefs. The object, as one Kentucky minister put it, was to make the Indian "a farmer, a citizen of the United States, and a Christian." Many native Americans actively resisted such attempts to redefine their identity. "Born free and inde- pendent," an observer noted, Indians were "struck with horror at whatever has the shadow of despotic power." Many tribes drove out white missionaries and forced Christian converts to participate in traditional Indian rites. To justify their ancestral values, native American leaders devised theories of cultural and religious dualism (see American Voices, above). They argued that the Great Spirit had made the two races different; as a Munsee prophet put it, "there are two ways to God, one for the whites and one for the Indians." Nevertheless, under pressure from white missionaries, many tribes broke into hostile religious factions. Among the Seneca of New York, for example, the prophet Handsome Lake promoted traditional agricultural ceremonies—the green corn dance, the strawberry festival, and the false-face pageant—that gave ritual thanks to the earth, plants, animals, water, and sun. But Handsome Lake also adopted some Christian precepts, such as belief in heaven and hell, and used them to discourage his followers from drinking alcohol, gambling, and practicing witchcraft. More conservative people among the Seneca clung to the old ways, believed in witchcraft, and resisted the influence of white missionaries. Strong ancestral values prompted Indians to reject European agricultural methods. Handsome Lake's political enemy, Red Jacket, led the Seneca in opposing innovations such as having men work in the fields. Traditionally, Indian women were responsible for providing much of the food supply—growing corn, squash, beans, and other basic foods—and because of matriiin- eal customs they often controlled the inheritance of cultivation rights on certain lands. Unlike white farm women, they enjoyed authority over property rights, and among most Eastern Woodland peoples, women's economic importance led to political responsibility. For Chapter 8 Toward a Continental Nation 1790-1820 example, the Shawnee chose female "war" and "civil" chiefs; the latter could prevent the dispatch of war parties and save captives from being tortured. Consequently, Indian women insisted on retaining their role as cultivators, and few Indian men wished to assume traditional female responsibilities, preferring the roles of hunter and warrior. Even Christian Indians would not give up their social identity. They viewed themselves not as individuals but as members of a clan, all descendants of the same person. Most clans adopted an animal—a deer, turtle, fox, or bear—as their totem, or designation, often because of a vision of their original ancestor. Indians also superimposed new Christian identities onto familiar clan spirits. To accept European views of the individual or the family would be to repudiate clan identity and the essence of Indian life. The Cherokee. Native Americans assimilated European ways only under special circumstances and for specific purposes. Beginning in the late eighteenth century, the Cherokee of Georgia and the Carolinas organized an unusually centralized political system to resist the advancing white settlers who wanted their lands for growing cotton. A Cherokee national council headed by two respected chiefs oversaw all 13,000 members of the tribe with respect to certain activities—maintaining a mounted police force, abolishing clan revenge for murder, and establishing a limited patrilineal inheritance system. These innovations were implemented by a small faction of Christian Cherokee mixed-bloods. Most mixed-bloods were the offspring ol white fur traders and Indian women. Growing up in a bicultural world, they learned the language and political ways of white people. A few were quite prosperous and dressed and behaved like white planters. James Vann, a Georgia Cherokee, owned more than twenty black slaves, two trading posts, and a gristmill. Forty other Cherokee mixed-blood families owned a total of more than 1,000 slaves. When whites attempted to oust the Cherokee from their ancestral land, first in 1806 and again in 1817, the mixed-bloods attempted to forge a strong national identity among their people. Sequoyah, a mixed- blood, developed a system of writing for the Cherokee language, and the tribe published a newspaper. In 1827 the Cherokee introduced a new charter of government modeled directly on the U.S. Constitution. Mixed-blood Christians were caught between two cultures and accepted by neither. Whites treated them as Indians, to be pushed ever westward, and full-blooded Cherokee condemned their white values. During the 1820s full-bloods seized power in the Great Smoky Mountains and, because of their numbers, gradually took control of the national council, which then resisted both cultural assimilation and forced removal. Like Divisions among the Cherokee In 1821 Sequoyah, a mixed-blood, devised a wrinen script for the Cherokee language, and the tribe published a newspaper printed in both English and Cherokee. Few full-blooded Cherokee could read either language; they maintained the traditional oral culture. most native Americans, the Indians of the Old Southwest wanted to practice their traditional culture on ancestral lands. "We would not receive money for land in which our fathers and friends are buried," a Creek chief declared. "We love our land; it is our mother." Continental Empire: Spain and the United States As the United States challenged Indian control of the Old Southwest, Spain reasserted its claims to the lands stretching from Texas to California. Before the 1760s Spain had suffered one setback alter another In North America, losing control of the Carolinas and Georgia to British settlers and Louisiana to French fur traders. A further blow came in 1763, at the end of the French and Indian War, when the Spanish monarchy was forced to cede Florida to Britain. Yet Spain also profited from the peace settlement of 1763. When France ceded Canada to Britain, it withdrew completely from North America, ceding Louisiana to its Spanish ally. Once again Spain held title to all lands west of the Mississippi River (see Map 8.6).

It established missions and forts in California (such as rhar ar Monterey), expanded Spanish settlements in New1 Mexico, and by joining in the American War of Independence, reclaimed Florida from Britain. By 1800, this dream had been shattered by Indian uprisings in California and Texas, Napoleon's seizure of Louisiana, and American threats to Florida. Chapters Toward a Continental Nation 1790-1820 did not mean control. Louisiana remained primarily a French colony, inhabited in 1763 by 4,000 French- speaking whites and 5,000 enslaved blacks, while much of Texas, New Mexico, and southern Arizona was dominated by Apache peoples, who raided the scattered small Spanish settlements for horses and supplies. Spain's Borderlands Empire. During the reign of Carlos III (1759-1788), a dynamic and American-oriented monarch, Spanish officials attempted to create a grand continental empire by uniting these territories on the northern border of New Spain with new settlements in California. Under the direction of Jose de Galvez, Spanish troops established military presidios at San Diego, Santa Barbara, Monterey, and San Francisco while the Franciscan friar Junipero Serra set up missions there and elsewhere along the California coast. To protect Spanish claims to the region, a naval expedition explored the coast as far north as Alaska, seeking to expel Russian fur trappers. As they repelled Russian advances in the west, Spanish officials tried to dislodge the British in the east. In 1779 Spain entered the War of Independence on the American side and, in a series of daring campaigns directed by Bernardo de Galvez (the nephew ol Jose), captured British forts along the Mississippi River and at Mobile and Pensacola. Those victories enabled Spain to win the return of Florida in the Paris peace accords of 1783. To pacify the vast borderland region from Florida to California, the Spanish devised a new Indian policy. Emulating French practice, Bernardo de Galvez, who became the viceroy of New Spain in 1785, pursued a practice of divide and rule.

These treaties eliminated the threat of war until the I 840s, providing the United Stares with a much-needed period of peace and security. Regional Diversity and National Identity dered local commanders to contain or exterminate the warlike Apache, if possible by fomenting disputes between them and other Indian peoples so that they would "destroy one another." More cooperative peoples would be offered treaties and gifts—especially arms and alcohol—to make them dependent on Spanish trade. These treaties and trade brought peace to New Spain's northern frontier by the late eighteenth century and allowed the movement of Spanish ranchers and farmers from Mexico into Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. In California, however, Spanish policy led to rebellion as troops raped native women and drafted labor for work at the missions. Also, as the missionaries converted the Indians to Christianity and a more settled life, European diseases cut the native population along the coast nearly in half, from 60,000 in 1769 to 35,000 in 1800. After only a few decades of restored vigor the Span ish Borderlands Empire came under pressure from the newly independent and highly aggressive American republic. To deter American settlement west of the Appalachians, Spanish authorities restricted American trade on the Mississippi River in 1784 and entered into an alliance with the Creek peoples, who also feared American frontiersmen. But American threats and military setbacks in Europe forced Spain to accept Pinckney's Treaty of 1795, which gave Americans tree access to the great river and voided Spanish land claims in the Ohio River Valley and along the Mississippi. To curry favor with Napoleon and prevent further American expansion, Spain ceded Louisiana to France in 1800 and reacted strongly when the Louisiana Purchase undermined this strategy. Spanish diplomats argued that Louisiana was limited to lands along the Mississippi River (the present-day stares of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri). In contrast, Thomas Jefferson claimed that the territory extended to the Rio Grande and the Rocky Mountains, which would place all of Texas and half of New Mexico under American control. This issue remained unresolved at the end of the War of 1812, as did the status of West Florida, which had been occupied by American troops during the war. American adventurers also had their eye on Easr Florida and mounted insurrections against Spanish authorities there (see Map 8.7). John Quincy Adams and the West. All the disputes between Spain and the United States were resolved by- John Quincy Adams. Although he was the son of John Adams, the Federalist president, John Quincy joined the Republican partv before the War of 1812. As secretary of state under President Monroe, the younger Adams pursued an expansionist western policy that would have astounded his father. In 1817, when General Andrew Jackson led an expedition into East Florida, seized two Spanish forts, and executed two British subjects, accusing them of encouraging Seminole raids into the United States, Adams defended the general despite strong reservations about his conduct. Indeed, Adams used the diplomatic crisis created by Jackson's attack to put Spain on the defensive. Threatening to invade Florida, he secured the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, in which Fast Florida was annexed to the United States. In return, the American government accepted responsibility for the financial claims of American citizens against Spain, renounced its dubious claim to Spanish Texas, and agreed on a compromise boundary between New Spain and the Louisiana Territory. Adams also negotiated important agreements with Great Britain. The Rush-Bagot Treaty- of 1817 eliminated a long-standing source of conflict by limiting British and U.S. naval forces on the Great Lakes. More important, in 1818 the two countries agreed to establish the border between the Louisiana Territory and British Canada at the 49th parallel. As a result of Adams's diplomatic efforts, the United States gained undisputed possession of nearly all of the land south of the 49rh parallel and between the Great Lakes and the Rocky Mountains. The Monroe Doctrine. Secretary Adams and President Monroe had this continental empire in mind when they outlined a new foreign policy that, thirty- years later, became known as the Monroe Doctrine. In an address to Congress in 1823, Monroe, at Adams's behest, warned Spain and other European powers to stay out of the Western Flemisphere. During and after the Napoleonic Wars, patriots in Mexico and other Spanish colonies had revolted and established independent republics. The United Stares had extended diplomatic recognition to the new republics, and now Monroe warned Spain not to try to subdue them. The president, hoping to prevent the Russians from extending their fishing camps and fur-trading posts south of Alaska, declared that the American continents were not "subject for further colonization" by the nations of Europe. In return, Monroe reiterated that it was the policy of the United States "not to interfere in the internal concerns" of European nations. Monroe and Adams had turned their backs on Europe. They now looked purposefully westward, envisioning an American empire that would stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The Slave South: A Distinctive Society Christianity and the promise of economic rewards to discipline workers, southern planters used coercion, terror, and suppression of open communication to keep slaves in line. Planters could use those tactics as long as they insulated their society from the rest of the nation. Immigration offered little assistance in building a southern labor force. Most migrants from the North and from Europe avoided the South, and the majority of those who did go there found jobs that did not force them to compete with cheap slave labor. Few immigrants settled there even during the 1850s, when there were growing opportunities for work in southern cities. The South actually lost free workers, because a significant portion of its white population, especially in the border states, migrated to the upper Ohio Valley and, during the 1850s, to Oregon and California. Few slaves arrived from Africa after 1808, when Congress banned their importation (and exportation). The high birth rate of the existing slave population provided the labor force needed for the westward expansion of the Cotton Kingdom (see Map 13.1). The Gang Labor System. Planters who grew cotton or sugar and owned more than twenty slaves forced their slaves into intensely specialized and disciplined work. In 1860 such planters accounted for only about 10 percent of all slaveholders but owned about 50 percent of the slaves. Those planters or their overseers assigned slaves specific tasks, which varied by season, and organized the hands into disciplined teams, or "gangs," as they were called. The gangs worked in die fields at a feverish and often brutal pace. Overseers, most of whom were white, and drivers, who were themselves slaves, used the threat of the whip to force their gangs into tight, coordinated units for plowing, hoeing, and picking. A traveler in Mississippi in 1854 watched an army of slaves return from the fields at the end of a summer day: First came, led by an old driver carrying a whip, forty of the largest and strongest women I ever saw together; they were all in a simple uniform dress of a bluish check stuff, the skirts reaching little below the knee; then legs and feet were bare; they carried themselves loftily, each having a hoe over the shoulder, and walking with a free, powerful swing. Next marched the plow-hands with their mules, "the cavalry, thirty strong, mostly men, hut a few of them women." Finally, "a lean and vigilant white overseer, on a brisk pony, brought up the rear." As large-scale cotton and sugar production grew, gang labor became more common than the somewhat less demanding "task" system that prevailed in the cultivation of other crops and had been the most common way of organizing slave labor before 1820. Plantation owners could not have organized free farm workers to labor under the discipline of the gang system. On family farms and farms with only a few slaves, workers, both free and slave, insisted on a degree of independence and on work routines involving a variety of tasks. In the South as well as the North, whenever farm owners tried to organize free workers into gangs, the laborers demanded wages that made their output unprofitable. Or they simply quit, preferring to find employment as sharecroppers, casual workers, or factory hands. There wTas a great difference between the high wages that free laborers would have demanded from cotton planters and the cost of rearing and maintaining slaves. That saving in labor costs represented the economic gain planters reaped from slavery. Harvesting Sugarcane This warercolor by Franz Flolzlhuber shows slaves harvesting sugarcane in the late 1850s in southern Louisiana, where American sugar production was concentrated. Sugar plantations, which had been the first to introduce gang labor, were even harder on slaves than were cotton plantations because of the continuous ditching and draining of marshlands and the laborious processing of the cane. .194 Chapter 13 Sections and Sectionalism 1840-1860 McCORMICK'S FIRST REAPER The McCormick Reaper, 1851 The McCormick reaper was a complex piece of machinery, hut it was designed to be operated and repaired by average farmers. Company advertisements indicated that its parts were "numbered and marked with paint, showing the connection of the parts with one another so that they can readily be put together by the farmer." In 1851, at the Crystal Palace Exhibition in London, the first world's fair in the industrial era, Cyrus McCormick and Samuel Colt displayed their machine- tooled products. The amazement of British manufacturers quickly turned to anxiety when McCormick and Colt built factories in Great Britain that used American machinery and production techniques. Two teams of technicians sent by the British government to investigate American factories reported that many different industries were organized "in large factories, with machinery applied to almost every process, the extreme subdivision of labor, and all reduced to an almost perfect system of manufacture." The Impact of Factory Workers. The increasing scale and complexity of production, however, made it difficult for manufacturers ro estimate the demand for their products. During the 1850s periods of overproduction followed by the layoff and dismissal of workers became common. One such episode coincided with the Panic of 1857—a crisis produced by overexpansion of railroad investment—and a long depression followed. Unemployment remained at about 10 percent until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. Steam power and assembly lines further sharpened the class divisions that had begun to emerge in the 1820s and 1830s. To make the most of their large new investments, manufacturers increased the pace at which their workers toiled, and many workers resisted. For example, in 1845 a group of workers in Lowell, Massachusetts, under the leadership of Sarah G. Bagley, a weaver, formed the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association to protest a speedup. As working conditions became more grueling, most of the young women who had poured into factories left the paid work force to marry and raise families. Immigration Manufacturers turned more and more to immigrants— men and women largely from Ireland and the German stares. Lacking the economic opportunities available to Americans, immigrants were willing to work for longer periods of time, at lower wages, and with greater intensity. As a result, in the 1840s immigrants began to fill the unskilled labor force. By 1860 immigrants accounted for more than a fourth of the white adult men in the United States and more than a third of those in the North. Between 1820 and 1860 about 2 million Irish immigrants settled in the LJnited States, along with 1.5 million Germans and 750,000 Britons (see Figure 13.2). Some of the immigrants were skilled workers, hut more than two- thirds were peasants, unskilled laborers, and farmers dislocated by industrial and agricultural advances in Europe. Most of the newcomers took low-skilled jobs in factories, construction projects, docks, warehouses, and private homes. No federal legislation restricted immigration, and state immigration laws, which attempted to set minimum health standards and exclude paupers, were ineffective. The economic situation of immigrants varied greatly by national group. The wealthiest were the British, many of whom were professionals, former landowners, and skilled workers. Many German immigrants were prosperous enough to draw on their own savings to finance travel and buy land in America. The poorest immigrants were the Irish. The immigration of the Irish had more to do with poverty in their homeland than with economic opportunity in America. Although they arrived in increasing numbers during the 1830s, the Irish began to come in force only in 1847, after a devastating potato famine in The Northeast and the Midwest: The Industrial Revolution Accelerates Immigration to the United States. 1S20-1860 Immigration accelerated dramatically in the late 1840s. Fewer immigrants arrived in the middle and late 1850s as economic conditions improved in Ireland and the German states and the United States entered a depression. Ireland. They found new homes in the Northeast, especially in the cities of New England. By 1850 the Irish accounted for more than a third of the workers in Boston. Their labor enabled Boston industrialists to compete for the first time with manufacturers in the smaller mill towns of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. By I860 each of the largest factories producing women's clothing in Boston employed about a hundred young Irishwomen. During the late 1840s and early 1850s the Irish made only a modest contribution to the farm population. Although most had been farmers in Ireland, they were too poor to buy land in the United States. Living conditions for many Irish immigrants, like those for other unskilled immigrants and native-born day laborers, proved to be only marginally better than the grinding poverty and rampant disease that had filled their lives in the Old World. Per capita consumption of food increased during the Industrial Revolution, and most immigrants were much better nourished than they had been in Europe. Even so, many unskilled laborers could not afford to buy the food they needed to keep up the intense pace of factory work. In addition, the stress and insecurity of work drove many unskilled workers to spend an increasing portion of their income on the entertainment and alcoholic relief found in taverns. Malnutrition increased in the largest cities, resulting in higher rates of miscarriage and death from infectious diseases. The crowding of immigrants in the old commercial cities of the Northeast threatened public health. Sanitation systems were primitive. Poorly sealed privies drained into drinking wells, and open sewers ran through the streets. Infectious diseases ravaged the weakened, malnourished poor. Epidemics of cholera. The Status of Immigrants, 1855 The painter Charles F. Rlnuvelt was one of the rare artists of the period who made immigrants and African-Americans his subject, and he treated both groups with realism and sympathy. In this painting he might have meant to highlight the generosity of African-Americans by portraying a black woodcutter helping lost immigrants even though the new immigrants, solely by virtue of the color of their skin, enjoyed higher status.

In the summer of 1849 cholera epidemics hit New York, St. Louis, and Cincinnati. More than 5,000 people, mostly immigrants, died in New York, and many entire families succumbed. Wealthy families moved out of the cities during the epidemics, while, as one observer wrote, the immigrants remained crowded "into a few wretched hovels, amidst filth and bad air, suffering from personal neglect and poisoned by eating garbage [at| which a well-bred hog on a western farm would turn up his snout." In 1860 mortality rates in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston reached a level of more than thirty-four deaths per thousand population annually, compared with about fifteen per thousand in rural areas. Irish Identity and Anti-Catholicism The Catholic Church. In the 1840s and 1850s the United States remained overwhelmingly Protestant in private allegiance and public culture. But many of the new immigrants—French-Canadians, many Germans, and particularly the Irish—relied on the Catholic Church not only to sustain their spiritual lives bur also to reinforce their sense of class and ethnic identity. The Church's expansion closely paralleled the growth of Irish immigration, increasing from 16 dioceses and 700 churches in the 1840s to 45 dioceses and 3,000 churches by 1860. Throughout the areas serried by Irish immigrants, traveling priests were replaced by resident ones. The Irish purchased many church buildings from Protestant congregations that had moved to more spacious quarters. In towns and cities, using the church as a foundation, the Irish also built a network of charitable societies, orphanages, militia companies, parochial schools, newspapers, social clubs, and political organizations. These community institutions supported Irish immigrants in their search for housing, jobs, education, and security. These new institutions had no equivalent in Ireland. They developed in the United Stares in response to the desire of Irish immigrants to maintain their native culture, to which existing American institutions were hostile or, at best, indifferent. The church network was important to immigrants in large cities, especially those who worked in factories. It provided community services and a sense of group identity, much as a labor union might have done. The institutions that the Irish created had a great impact on later groups of Catholic immigrants. Because the Irish arrived early and because many spoke English, they built the church structure and the urban political machinery through which most European Catholic immigrants established a place for themselves in American life. The relative autonomy of Catholic communities disturbed many American Protestants, still the dominant majority in almost ali of the United States. During the 1830s, when Irish immigration first started to increase, lurid anti-Catholic propaganda began to circulate. Its authors raised the specter of a sinister, highly organized menace. According to the propaganda, the pope, acting through Catholics over whom he exerted total authority, was plotting to subvert republican institutions. Samuel F. B. Morse. A leading anti-Catholic propagandist was Samuel F. B. Morse, who would later make the first commercial adaptation of the telegraph. In 1834 Morse published Foreign Conspiracy against the Liberties of the United States anonymously. The book came out under his own name in 1835 and was endorsed by Protestant ministers of many denominations. Morse declared that the "past history" of Roman Catholics and "the fact that they everywhere act together, as if guided by one mind, admonish us to be jealous of their influence, and to watch with unremitted care all their movements in relation to our free institutions." He warned in particular of the political facility of Irish Catholics, who "in an especial manner clanned together, and kept alive their foreign feelings, associations, habits and manners." Morse advocated the formation of an "Anti-Poperv Union" to resist the perceived Catholic threat. Millions of young Americans read Foreign Conspiracy in Protestant Sunday schools and public libraries and schools. It became a textbook for anti-Catholic crusaders. In 1838 the citizens of Sutton and Millhury, Massachusetts, asked Congress to investigate "whether there are not now those amongst us, who, by their oath of allegiance to a foreign despotic Prince or Power, are solemnly bound to support his interests and accelerate his designs." Native American Clubs. The anti-Catholic movement became exceptionally intense because of the dislocations associated with industrialization. It appealed especially to mechanics who had lost their jobs or feared that they might lose them as a consequence of the factory' system. By attacking Catholics, they could blame cheap immigrant labor for their economic situation and at the same time persuade themselves that they had a superior culture and religion. Threatened workers took the lead in organizing Native American Clubs, which called for an extension of the waiting period before naturalization from five to twenty-one years, the restriction of public offices to native-born Americans, and exclusive use of the (Protestant) Authorized Version of the Bible in public schools. Even workers who felt secure in their jobs were afraid that their children would face competition from immigrants. They strongly opposed proposals from The Northeast and the Midwest: The Industrial Revolution Accelerates Riot in Philadelphia Philadelphia's anri-lrish rioring climaxed in Southwark on June 7, 1844. Pennsylvania's governor, John Cadwalader, had called our the militia to protect Catholic churches, including one (pictured in background) in which young Irish- Americans had stored muskets for scll- defcnsc. The Protestant rioters and the militia exchanged musket tire, and the rioters even tired a cannon into the militia. Militia reinforcements ended the riots, but Philadelphia's politics became focused on ethnic and racial issues. Catholic clergymen and Democratic legislators in many northeastern states that Catholics' taxes be reserved for parochial (religious) schools—thus weakening the public schools. Another source of anti-Catholic sentiment was the temperance movement as a number of evangelical ministers denounced the abuse of alcohol among Irish immigrants. Such appeals won recruits to the business class among native-born Protestant workers and impeded the development of a labor movement across ethnic and religious lines. Many Protestant laborers became convinced that they had more in common with their employers than with Catholic workers. In almost every city with a large Catholic immigrant population, the anti-Catholic movement turned to violence. In 1834, in Charlestown, Massachusetts, a quarrel between Catholic laborers in an Ursuline convent and Protestant workers in a neighboring brickyard turned into a full-scale riot. The anti-Catholic mob, convinced that a young Protestant woman was being held against her will, drove out the residents of the convent and burned it to the ground. Urban rioting escalated during the 1840s as the Irish began to acquire political power in eastern cities. In Philadelphia the violence peaked in 1844 after the Catholic bishop persuaded public school officials to use both Protestant and Catholic versions of the Bible. Anti-Irish rioting, provoked by the city's Native American Clubs, lasted for two months and escalated into open warfare between the Protestants and the Pennsylvania militia, causing many casualties. Business-Class Consumption In the mid-1850s the annual increase in per capita income approached 2.5 percent, a remarkable rate that the United States has never since matched. The nation achieved this rate despite the great surges of immigration during the 1840s and 1850s, which tended to reduce per capita income. These phenomenal income gains allowed native- born Americans with property or skills to reap an extraordinary material bonanza. During the 1840s and 1850s industrialization brought a sweeping wave of consumption to middle-class life in the North. New consumer goods served as badges of economic success and membership in the business class. The availability of inexpensive mass-produced goods, many of them new during the 1840s and 1850s, made the trappings of status widely accessible to the middle class. The new material culture reinforced a prideful sense of northern uniqueness that increasingly united affluent and upwardly mobile Americans from New England through the Great Lakes states. Middle-Class Housing: The Balloon Frame. When they could afford it, middle-class families built their homes of brick and stone. But wooden residences became much more numerous during the 1840s, and they were constructed very differently from log cabins or traditional frame buildings. In the 1830s American carpenters had devised a faster method to construct housing: the balloon frame. Traditional wood construction depended on the careful fitting together of heavy timbers; experienced housewrights fashioned a strong frame with mortise- and-tenon joints, whereas western farmers fitted trimmed logs together. The balloon frame, much lighter in weight (as its name implied) but almost as strong, formed a house with a vertical grid of thin wooden studs joined by nails to cross-pieces at the top and bottom. Once the carpenter had thrown up the frame, he Chapter 14 Disrupting the Union 1846-1860 sonian term Republican for themselves. The Republicans emphasized absolute opposition ro rhe expansion of slaver)' into any new territories—generalizing the principle of the Wilniot Proviso—and ran their first candidates in the Congressional elections of that year. The Know-Nothings. Another party—the "Know- Nothings"—was already attracting support from former Whigs. The party had its origins in the anti-immigrant, anri-Catholic passions that had flared in the 1840s. In 1850 various secret anri-Catholic societies had banded together in the Order of the Star-Spangled Banner; a year later they formed a new political party, the American party. Its members sometimes answered outsiders' questions by saying "I know nothing," which gave the party its nickname. The program of rhe Know-Nothings, however, was not mysterious. They supported the program of the Native American Clubs and in addition advocated literacy tests for voters, which they thought would disfranchise most recent immigrants. The Know- Nothings attempted to unite northern and southern voters behind a program of narivisr opposition to Catholics—both Irish and German—and the "alien menace." Republicans and Know-Nothings Cooperate. In the 1854 elections in the North, the Republicans cooperated with the better established Know-Nothings. Whereas the Republicans stressed free soil, the Know-Nothings emphasized anti-Catholic nativism. The Republicans and Know-Nothings were wary of each other, uncertain which parry had the better formula for long-term political success. But a coalition of the two new parries had much to recommend it. The conspiracy theory of the Know-Nothings—suggesting a threat to republican insti- tutions—paralleled the free-soi lets' description of the Slave Power conspiracy and created the ideological basis for the coalition. Many Republicans were uncomfortable with fervent anti-Catholicism but appreciated rhe fact that outside the South Know-Nothings applauded free-soil policy, regarding its potential antiblack thrust as being consistent with the Know-Nothing program of excluding everyone but white Protestants from America. There were also practical political reasons for a coalition. Neither of the national parties, the Whigs and the Democrats, had supported their programs, and most of the supporters of both the Know-Nothings and the Republicans were former Whigs. In 1854 the Know-Noth- ings won a number of seats in Congress and temporarily gained control of the state governments of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. Together, the Republicans and Know'-Nothings won a majorin' in the House of Representatives in 1854. Suddenly the Republican-Know- Nothing coalition seemed a potent alternative to the Democrats and popular sovereignty. Republican Ideology versus the Defense of Slavery Like most American political parties, the Republican party was a coalition, and its platform contained proposals designed to appeal to each of the groups that made up its alliance. But the party's ideas and political language were not just the sum of those proposals. Republican ideology was strongly shaped by a perception of the different kinds of human personalities and societies that developed under slavery and freedom. In rhe Republican view, slavery produced only two classes of people; masters and slaves. The master class was corrupted by wielding power that knew' no limits. In their dealings with slaves—and with their poorer white neighbors—slave masters would inevitably claim limitless privilege and inflict limitless injustice, this kind of excess could only produce habits of subservience, ignorance, and sloth among slaves and poor whites. In the Republicans' description of a free society no person had unlimited power over another. The ancient division of society' into permanent classes was eradicated by freedom and mobility. As Abraham Lincoln, a Whig w'ho became a Republican after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, put it, in northern society "there is no permanent class of hired laborers among us." Every man had a chance to become an owner and an employer, and "if any continue through life in the condition of the hired laborers, it is not the fault of rhe system, bur because of either a dependent nature which prefers it, or improvidence, folly, or singular misfor- tune." In the faith of Lincoln and his fellow Republicans the typical men and women of such a society would be proudly independent, creative, ambitious, and energetic. Such people would be disciplined not by authority but by their own free determination to meet their responsibilities ro their families, churches, and communities. Thus, the Republicans asserted the values of individualism and republicanism in the face of increasing class divisions and tensions in the industrializing North. Southerners sawr things very differently. They had long defended slavery on racist grounds; black people, they claimed, were inferior, lacked any capacity for freedom, and were dependent on their benevolent masters. Many southerners invoked St. Paul's recognition of unequal stations in life. But in the 1850s, in response to northern attacks on slavery and celebrations of free labor, a new' defense of slavery began to take shape. Proslavery novelists, for example, produced more than a dozen books between 1852 and 1854 to counter the searing images of Uncle Tom's Cabin. In two books, Sociology for the South; or, the Failure of Free Society (1854) and Canni-
