Columbus did not recognize his true destination. (Certain that God intended him to f ind the Indies, lie resisted recognizing the novelty ol his discovers. He was ofi by about S000 miles. At first Columbus confused bis actual location, tin- Bahamas, with an island off the coast of japan. He coasted along ( aiba anti Hispaniola (Haiti >. expecting at am moment to catch sight of gold-roofed Japanese temples or to happen upon a fleet of Chinese junks.

Columbus crossed the Atlantic three more times between 1493 and 1504. On his second voyage he established a permanent colony at Hispaniola (in his view tin* most likelv site for gold) and explored other Caribbean islands. On his third voyage tie reached "the Spanish Sluin' (or mainland)—Venezuela oil the continent of South \menca: and on his last voyage he made landfalls throughout Central America. Everywhere he looked for proof that these lands formed part of Asia—probably, he came to believe, the Malay Peninsula. Columbus tlied rich in titles, treasure, and tales—everything but recognition. During the last decade ofhis life, most Spaniards no longer believed that Columbus hud discovered the Indies or anyplace else of significance. d shortly alter his death in 1506. another Italian stamped his own name on the New World. Amerigo Vespucci. a Florentine banker with a Hair for self-promotion, cruised the coast of Brazil in 1501 and again in 1503. His sensational report of his travels misled Martin Ualdseemuller. a young German mupmaker. into crediting Vespucci yvith discovering the harrier between Europe and Asia, and so naming it "America." 77a ■ four roja^cs of Columbus \ rs])acri The Americas yvere a newyvorld only to European latecomers. To the Asian peoples and their native American descendants who had settled the continents tens of thousands of years earlier, Columbus' new world yeas their own old world. But it is doubtful that the first nomadic hunters yvho crossed from Siberia oyer the Bering Strait to Alaska considered themselves discoverers or recognized what they had found—a truly new world, one wholly uninhabited hv humans. The Firs! Inhabitants The first passage of people from Asia to America probably took place during a prehistoric glacial period—either before 35,000 n.< or about 10 000 years later— when huge amounts of the world's water froze into sheets of ice. Sea levels dropped Hunters ant! fftthertrrs Wwwti in agricultural societies so drastically that the Bering Strait became a broad, grass) plain. Across that land bridge between the two continents both humans and animals escaped icebound Siberia for ice-free Alaska. Whenever tlie first migration took place, the movement of Asians to America continued, even after 8000 r.c. when world temperatures rose again, and the water from melting glaciers flooded back into the ocean, submerging the Bering Strait. Over a span of 25.000 years settlement spread down the Alaskan coast, then up river valley's and along mountain passes deeper into the North American mainland, and finally throughout Central and South America. Native Americans remained nomadic hunters and gatherers lor thousands of years, as did mam Europeans, Africans, and Asians of those millennia. Increasingly, however. American cultures diversified, especially after about 55(H) u.c.. when the peoples of central Mexico discovered how to cultivate food crops. As this "agricul- tural revolution" spread slowly northward, native American societies were able to grow larger and develop distinctive forms of economic, social, and political organization. By the end of the fifteenth century, the inhabitants of North America, perhaps 5 to 10 million people, spike as many as 10(H) languages, some as different Irom each other as English is from Chinese. Although later Europeans, like Columbus. lump'd these societies together In calling them Indian—am cultural unity had vanished long before 1492. The simplest Indian societies were those that still relied on hunting and gath- ering—like the Shoshone of the Great Basin (parts of present-dav Nevada. Oregon, and Idaho); the Eskimos of the Arctic; and the Serrano. Cahnilla, I.uiseno, and Dieguciio of southern California, Arizona, and the Baja peninsula of Mexico. Stark deserts and frozen tundra defied cultivation anti yielded food supplies that could sustain nomadic bands numbering no more than about 50 people. Families occasionally joined together for a collective hunt or wintered in common quarters, but for most of the vear they scattered across the landscape, the women gathering plants and seeds, making baskets, and cooking meals while the men hunted for meat and hides Political authority lav with either the male family head or the "headman of a small hand: "shamans"—any triliesincn claiming spiritual powers—enlisted the supernatural to assist individuals. Societies of Increasing Complexity In the densely forested belt that stretched from Newfoundland to the Bering Strait, resources more generous than those of the tundra to the north made for larger populations and more closely knit societies. Northeastern hands like the Moutagnais, the Micmac, and the Penobscot and northwestern tribes like the Yellowknife anti the Beaver traveled forests of evergreen in moccasins and snowshoes, stalking deer, elk. moose. I tear, and caribou; they speared fish in icy lakes and swiff streams from birch-bark canoes. Their environment encouraged cooperative economic pursuits: leading men assigned several families to specific territories that they hunted together, dividing the returns among the whole bam I. Religious beliefs strengthened the ties of kinship: each familv had a "totem," a particular animal from which they claimed descent. While men dominated Indian bands based on hunting bv virtue of their skill and knowledge of the terrain, women assumed more influence in societies that relied for part of their food on settled agriculture. Among the Pueblo peoples of Arizona and New Mexico, tlie liopi and Znni tribes, men hunted bison and cultivated com and beans, but women owned the fields, the crops, and even the tools, They also owned Only 60 of Jamestown's 500 inhabitants lived through the winter of 1609—161(1. known as the "starving time." Some desperate colonists unearthed and ate corpses: one settler even butchered his wife. Reports of starvation and staggering death rates stiffened the Virginia Com- I pane's resolve: in 1611 it imposed on the colonists what amounted to martial Lm. Company officials in Virginia organized the settlers into work gangs and severely I punished the lazy and the disorderly. Still tire company failed to turn a profit. \iul after 1617, skirmishes with the Indians became more brutal and frequent, as rovvsol tobacco plants encroached on tribal lands farther and farther inland. The noxious weeds'' embarrassed advocates of colonization in Kngland its much as they angered the Indians. After a decade of settlement, Virginia's sole contribution to the empire was the smoke filling England's taverns and brothels. Even James I, whose standards I of hygiene and morality often caused his own courtiers to wince, condemned the use I of tobacco as a filthy and dissipated habit. Reform and a Boom in Tobacco Desperate to salvage their investment and their respectability, the company manag- I el's in 161S set in place a sweeping reform program. To attract more capital and I colonists to Virginia, the company established a "headlight" system for granting land I to individuals. Those already settled in the colony received KM) acres apiece, new I settlers each received 50 acres, and anyone who paid the passage of other immigrants I to Virginia—either family members or servants—received 50 acres jier "head." The I company also dispensed with martial law, allowing (lie planters to elect a represents- I rive assembly. Along with a governor and an advisory council appointed by the coin- I pane, the Mouse of Burgesses had the authority to make laws for the colony. It met I for the first time in 1619, commencing what would become a strong tradition of I representative government in the English colonies. The new measures to encourage migration met with immediate success. For I several years both free immigrants and hound laborers surged into Virginia. Of tin- I hound laborers, some were indentured servants who agreed to w ork a set number of I years, usually four to seven, for the planters paving the cost of their passage. Others I were sharecropping tenants who were to cultiv ate company land; for sev en years they I were to turn half of their earnings over to the Virginia Coinpauy, and at the end of I their terms of service, they were to receive 50 acres. Free immigrants poured into Virginia, too, for during the 1620s the tobacco I economy took olf. As demand soared and prices peaked in European markets, those I with an eye for profit took their chances in Virginia, planted even inch of their farms I in tobacco, and reaped windfalls. Because ol the gains that free settlers stood to make I by growing tobacco, efforts by the company to diversify Virginia's economy failed I That was jus! one consequence ot the tobacco boom: another was the deaths of must I English men and women who came to Virginia during the 1620s. Those who came to Virginia during that decade were in the v anguard of an I English migration to the Chesapeake that numbered between 130,000 and 150,000 I over the seventeenth century. Drawn from tin- ranks of ordinary' English working I people, the immigrants were predominantly men, outnumbering women by six I I one. Most were young, ranging in age between 15 and 24: and generally. (treatise I their vouth. without skills or wealth. Three-quarters of all the newcomers arrived in the Chesajieakc as indentured servants. For most of the new servants, tlx- crossing to Virginia was simply the hist of mam moves, each undertaken in the hops- of finding work. Although England's population had been rising since the middle of the fifteenth century. the demand for farm laborers was falling because many landowners were converting croplands into pastures lor sheep. A severe recession in the textile indnstrv earl) in the sevent<*enth centnrv leli even more English unemployed. The search for work pushed young men and women out of their villages, sending them through the countryside and then into tlie cities. Down ami out in Ixmdon. Bristol, or Liverpool, some decided to make their next move across the Atlantic and signed indentures. Pamphlets promoting immigration promised a bounteous environment, a balmy climate, and. once servants finished their terms, abundant land and quick riches. The recruits to the Chesapeake may not have swallowed whole these rosy promises, but the lack of work, the low wages, and the high prices in England made them desperate enough to try their luck in America anyway. Even the most skeptical immigrants must have been shocked at what they found. The death rate in Virginia during the lfi20s was higher than that of England during times of epidemic disease. The life expectancy for Chesapeake men who reached the age of 20 was a mere -IS years; for women it was lower still. Servants fared worst of all, since malnutrition, overwork, and abuse made them vulnerable to disease. As masters scrambled to make quick profits, they extracted the maximum amount of work Itefore death carried oil'their laliorers. An estimated 40 percent of servants never regained their freedom because they did not survive to the end of their indentured terms. The expanding cultivation of tobacco also claimed many lives by putting unliear- able pressure on Indian land Following Powhatan's death in 1017. leadership of the confederaev passed to Opcchancanoiigh, who watched, year alter year, the tobacco mania grow. In March 1022 he coordinated a full-scale attack on white settlements that killed about one-fifth of tile white population of Virginia. Swift English reprisals wiped out whole tribes and cut down an entire generation of young Indian men. As tragic as the casualties on both sides was the view of Indians that the events of 1022 fixed ill the minds of the English—the lielief that all Indians were treacherous and cunning, incapable of being civilized and incorporated into English colonial society. Back in England, Joint Smith predicted the consequence: the Virginians now saw "just cause to destroy them [the Indians] by all meanes possible." News of the Indian war jolted English investors into determining the true state of their Virginia venture It tame to light that unscrupulous company officials in the ixilnnv had commandeered tenants to work their private plantations instead of company lands. Despite the tobacco boom, the Virginia Company was plunging toward bankruptcy. Nor was that the worst news. Stockholders discovered that over 3000 immigrants had not survived the brutal conditions of Chesapeake life. Arriving more dead than alive from scurvy, young servants had been snapped tip by labor-hungry tnbacco planters, who overworked and starved them in their rush for profits. All investigation bv king James brought out the grislv truth, causing the king to dissolve tlic V irginia Company and take control of the colony himself in 1624. Henceforth Virginia would lie governed as a royal colony. Indentured servitude \V"r with the confederacy llit* proprietors. Political unrest in North Carolina triggered lliree separate rebellions between 1677 and 1711. with near-anarchy pres ailing in intervening years. In South Carolina op|x>sition to the proprietors gathered strength more slowly, but in the end it exploded with equal force. Early Instability Immigrants from Barbados, the most numerous among the early settlers, came quickly to dominate South Carolina politics. Just as quickly, they objected to proprietary pow er. To offset the influence of the Barbadians, most ol whom were Anglican the proprietors encouraged tin- migration of French Huguenots and English Presbyterians and Baptists and awardetl them political office. The stream ol newcomers only heightened tensions, splitting South Carolinians into two camps with competing [jolitical and religious loyalties. While 1 Mjtli factions battled over proprietary rale, settlers spread out along the coastal plain north and south of Charleston. Searching for a profitable export, the first colonists raiser! grains and grazed cattle, foodstuff s 11 tat they exported to the West Indies. South Carolinians also developed a large trade in deerskins and other animal pelts with coastal tribes like the Yaniasee and the Creeks and Catawbas of the interior. More numerous than the Indians of the Chesapeake and even more deeply divided, the Carolina tribes competed to become the favored clients of white traders. Southeastern Indian economies quickly berarnc dependent on English pins, rum, and clothing. Indian Out of all these circumstances there developed another profitable sector of the slavery early Carolina economy—Indian slavery. To repay their debts to white traders. Indians enslaved and sold to white buyers large numbers of men, women, and children from rival trilies taken in war. Although Carolinians sent many of the captives to New England and tin* West Indies, Indian slavery existed in the colony for a century. Provisions, deerskins, and Indian slaves proved less profitable for South Carolin- ians than rice. The marshy coastal lowlands made ideal paddy fields, and their produce liecamc the colony s cash crop by the opening decades of the eighteenth century. Being in constant demand in Europe, rice yielded larger and more reliable returns than Chesapeake tobacco. It made South Carolina the richest colonv and South Carolina rice planters the richest people on the mainland ol North America. Unfortunately. South Carolina's coastal environment was less well suited lor human habitation. Its swamps were perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes and deadly microbes. For a century after the colony's initial settlement, appalling mortality rates prevented many planters from living long enough to appreciate their prosperity. Weakened by chronic malaria, settlers succumix*d in epic numbers to y ellow lever, smallpox, and respiratory infections. The white population grew slowly through immigration rather than natural increase, and numbered a mere 10.000 In- 1730. The first generations of South Carolinians had little in common hut the harsh conditions of frontier existence. Most colonists lived on isolated plantations, making only occasional trips to Charleston. Early deaths fragmented families and neighborhoods. Immigration alter 1700 only intensified the colony's ethnic and religious diversity. adding Swiss and German Lutherans, Scots-Irish Presbyterians, Welsh Baptists, and Spanish Jews, laical institutions that might have enhanced order remained The "Great Migration'' Hensons for long lives anil stable families Patients of settlement tvpicallv free men—lurmers. artisans, and merchants, most of whom were skilled and literate.

Unlike the Virginians who scattered across the (lliosapeakrhi I cl Hendrik and tin? other delegates made vague promises of loyalty, and then hauled ttwuy 30 wagons lull of presents. But would the colonies themselves unite? That was Franklin's worn'. On the way to the Album Congress lie had sketched out a framework for colonial cooperation Working with several others at tin' meeting, he proposed establishing a federal council composed of representatives from each colony, presided over by a president- general appointed by the Crown. The council would assume all responsibility for colonial defense and Indian policy, building forts and patrolling harbors with taxes levied on all Americans. The commissioners were hold enough to accept the plan, alarmed by the wavering Iroquois and the increasingly hold French threat. Franklin sailed hack down the Hudson with his plan endorsed and a call from the commissioners to establish 'one general government" for British North America. But the union I Mini at Albany was smothered by the jealous colonies, who were unwilling to sing yo-/irig/i-eig/i either in unison or separately. Not a single- assembly approved the Albany Flan of Union. New Englanders and Pennsylvanians did not want to help secure the claims of Virginians to the upper Ohio valley. Virginians, along with New Jerseyans, had refused even to attend the congress. And no American legislature was reads to surrender its cherished right to las inhabitants of its osvn colony—not to a federal council or am other IkmIs. "Everyone cries, a union is necessary." Franklin svrote Governor Shirles of Massachusetts in disgust; "but when they come to the manner and form of the union, their weak iummIIcs are perfectly distracted." If the Albans Congress pros ed one thing, il svas that American colonials were hopelessly divided. Franklin, of course, should have known better than to hope for an intercolonial union.

Most non-English white immigrants were fleeing liv es torn hy famine, warfare, and religions persecution.

Many had paid for passage hy signing indentures to work as servants in the New World. The immigrants and slaves who arrived in the colonies In-tween 1700 and 1775 W/g/i birth swelled an American population that was ulready growing dramatically from natural rah increase. The birth rate in eighteenth-century America was triple whnt.it is today. Most women Imre between five and eight children, ami most children survived to maturity. Even families of 10 or more children were not uncommon Franklin was tin-youngest son in a family of 17 children, Low rates of infant mortality and long life expectancy had been the rule in the northern colonies since the seventeenth century: after about 170(1 they also became more typical in the South. Franklin knew, better than most colonials, how quickly the colonies were growing lor in 1751 hi- hail written an essay on the subject. It clearly recognized the social awl jmlitical consequences ol the [xipulation explosion. People of different races speaking different languages. (relieving in different religions, und cherishing different customs created distinctive environments that ranged over a large territory. This diversity, coupled with the hectic pace of westward expansion after 1700, made it hard for colonials to share any common identity'. Far from fostering political union, almost every aspect ol social development set Americans at odds with one another. Older Rural Communities Once they disembarked at colonial ports, the free immigrants needed places to live .mil ways ot earning a livelihood. So. Ion, did the increasing numbers of native-1 xirn Americans, coming ol age every year: about half ol the colonial population in 1775 wav under Ifi. The places that probably appeultrd to many immigrants and younger aduuials were the scores of older niral communities lining the coast. Fnmtlrr mim The Paxton Boys Rrgulal c>"s western families, although often deeply pious, had only occasional contact with orgu- nizcd religion. The luck of churches was among I he mam hardships that made the lot of frontier women unenviable. Besides doing the usual chores of (arm women, western wives anil daughters joined male family members in the Helds. One traveler from the Fast expressed his astonishment at seeing German women in western Pennsylvania "at work abroad on the Farm mowing. Hoeing, Loading Dung into a Cart." Perhaps even more difficult to endure than the greater demands on their labor was the loneliness of their lives. Most women had little enthusiasm for moving Tar away frilln family and old friends. The reactions of women to lieiug uprooted and resettled in u wilderness cabin can be guessed at from the promise that one Scottish husband offered his wife: "We would get all these trees cut down . . . [so] that we would see from house to house." Social Conflict on the Frontier Despite tin1 discomforts of frontier life, cheap land lured many families to the West Benjamin Franklin hail observed the hordes of Seots-lrish and German immigrants I lingering in Philadelphia just long enough to scrape together the purchase price of a frontier farm. He had seen workers in liis own printshop grow restless until city life and light out for the frontier. From Franklin's point of view, the baekeountiy performed a valuable service by siphoning off surplus people from congested eastern settlements. But he knew, too, that the frontier was an American Pandora's lx>\: once I opened, the West unleashed discord and conflict, especially between the eastern seaboard and tile backcountry. In Pennsylvania, Franklin himself mediated one such contest between east and west. In 1763 a band of Seots-lrish farmers known as "the Paxton Boys" protested the government's inadeipiate protection of frontier settlers hv killing a number of Indians. Then the Paxton Bovs took their protests and their guns to Philadelphia j marching as far as Lancaster before Franklin intervened and promised redress of their grievances. Strife between east and west was even deadlier and more enduring in North and South Carolina. In IkiIIi colonies legislatures dominated bv coastal planters refused to grant inland settlers eipiitable political representation or even basic legal institutions In response to those injustices, two protest movements emerged in the Carolina interior, each known as the Bcgnlation. Farmers in the South Carolina backcountry organized their Regulation in the 1760s, after that colony's assembly refused to set up courts in the backcountCE Westerners were desperate for protection from outlaws who stole livestock, kidnaped and raped women, and tortured and murdered men. In the absence of courts the Regulators acted as vigilantes, meting out their own brand of grisly frontier justice i against these criminals. Regulator threats to march on Charleston itself finally panicked eastern political leaders into extending the court system, hut bitter memoritt lingered among westerners. Western North Carolinians organized their Regulation to protest not the absence of a legal system hut the conniption of local government, lawyers and trier- j chants, backed by wealthy eastern planters, moved into the western parts of tlut Till-: MOSAIC or Elt:UTEEXTH-CKNTl in AMERICA 131 colon) iind seized control of politics Then they used local olllee to exploit frontier settlers, charging exorbitant fees for legal services, imposing high taxes, and manipulating debt laws. Western fanners responded to these abuses with the Regulation: they-seized county' courts, liberated their jailed leaders, and at last squared off 2000 strong against an eastern militia led In the governor. Easterners crushed the Regulators at the Battle of Alamance in 1771 hut left frontier North Carolinians with an enduring hostility to the seaboard. Ethnic differences heightened sectional tensions between east and west. While people of English descent predominated along the Atlantic coast, Germans, Scots Irish, and other white minorities were concentrated in the interior. Mans English colonials regarded these* new immigrants as culturally inferior suit! politically subversive, hi 1729 Bostonians greeted the arrival of a boatload of Irish immigrants with a not. A few years later, a mob in Worcester. Massachusetts, set lire to a Scots-lrish Presbyterian church. Ftuthcr south, Charles Wood mason, un Anglican missionary in the Carolina hackeotnitre, condemned the arrival of "5 or 6000 Ignorant, mean, worthless, beggarlv Irish Presbyterians, the Scum of the Earth, the Refuse of Man- kind." who "delighted in a low. lazy, sluttish, heathenish, hellish life." German immigrants were generally credited with having steadier work habits, as well ns higher standards of sexual morality and personal hygiene. But like the clannish Scots-lrish. the Germans preferred to live, trade, and worship among themselves. They expressed little admiration for English political institutions, even less interest in citizenship, and a decided aversion to military service. Bv 1751 Franklin was warning that the Germans would retain their separate language and customs: instead of Anglicizing the Germans, the Pennsylvania English would be overran bv "the Palatine Boors." Even in South (,'arolina, a colony desperate for white settlers because of its black majority, the assembly considered restricting German immigration. Boundary Disputes and Tenant Wars Tire settlement of the frontier also triggered disputes between colonies over their boundaries. At the root of the confusion were the old colonial charters and their vague definitions of western I orders. which allowed groups of settlers and land speculators from different colonies to lay claim to the same tract of land. Thus was \evv York drawn into lights with Connecticut and Massachusetts, and Pennsy lvania with Connecticut and Virginia. The most serious of these border wars pitted New York against determined farmers from New England w ho bail settled in present-day Vermont: Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys. In the 1760s New York, backed by the Crown, claimed laud that Allen and lus friends had already purchased from New Hampshire. When New York tried to invalidate New England land titles and to extend its rule over Vermont, it reaped a whirlwind of opposition. For more than a decade Allen led a successful guerrilla resistance, harassing Yorker settlers anti officials, occupying Yorker courthouses, and setting up a competing judicial system in the Green Mountains. The spread of settlement also set the stage for mass revolts by farm tenants in those ureas where proprietors controlled vast amounts oflaud.

The first federal census, compiled in 1790. put the population at approximately I million people, divided about evenlx between tin northern and southern states. Virginia, the largest and most populous state, contained over half again as mam residents as Pennsylvania, its nearest rival. New York, where must settlers lived in the Hudson River vallev, ranked only fifth. The Republic's [population wax overwhelmingly concent rated along the eastern seaboard within 50 miles of the Tidewater. Only aliout 100,000 settlers lived bevond the Appalachians in the Tennessee and Kentucky territories, which were soon to become states. Tin area north ol the Ohio Riser was virtually unsettled bv whites. The great westward surge of population was just beginning. Within the Republic's boundaries were two major racial groups that lucked effective political influence: African-Americans and Indians. In 179(1 blacks numbered 750.0(H). almost one-fifth of the total population. Over 90 percent lived in the southern states Iron) Maryland to Georgia, most slaves who worked on tobacco and rice plantations. But there were tree blacks as well, their numbers increased h\ the ideals of lil>ert\ that the Revolution had fostered. In 1790 the free black population was larger, relative to the total African-American population, than it would lx- at any time before the Civil War. The census did not count the numbers of Indians living east of the Mississippi. North of the Ohio, the powerful Miami Confederacy discouraged settlement, although during the 1780s a small|x" epidemic hud decimated its numliers. To the south, five strong, well-organized tribes with a total population somewhere between 50.(K)0 and 100,000 dominated the region below the Ohio from the Appalachians to the Mississippi River. These were the Creeks. Cherokees. (,'liick- asaws. Choctaws, and Seininoles. In other words Indian nations in 1790 wielded effective control of more territory within the United States than the United States itself did. That situation would change, however, as the white population continued to double approximately every 22 years. Immigration contributed only a small part to this astonishing growth, lor on average, fewer than KUHHI Europeans arrived annually Ik-twee it 1790 and 1S20. The primary cause was natural increase, making the United States u singularly southful nation. In 1790 almost half of all white Americans were under Ifi years old and the average American womtm gave birth to neark eight children. Because of the extremely high birth rate (no nation in the world Icxlnv can match it), women did not live as long, and tints males made up slight Is more than lull the population, at least among whites.'' The age at first marriage was about 25 lor men. 2-1 lor women; but because of the large number of males on the frontier, it was significuntk lower in newly settled areas (on average perhaps 21 for males and less for females), which contributed to the high birth rate. This youthful, growing population remained overwhelmingly rural. Only 2-J towns or cities boasted a population of 25(H) or more, and 19 out ol 20 Americans lived outside them, In fact, in 1S(H) over 80 percent of American families were engaged in agriculture, a figure more than double that for England, the most industrialized country of the dav. 'Because the 1790 census did not include significant data on tin- black population, many of the statistical figures <|tiotnl for thi* rra appk onlv to whiton. Support for the two partiat Federalist ideas "nonpartisan'' system envisioned the Federalists guiding the government, the doni inent amounted to an electioneering tract: still, it voiced Washington's genuine fear of part) strife. But that vision had become obsolete: parties were an effective way nf expressing the interests of different social and economic groups within the nation Wluai the Republicans chose Thomas Jefferson to oppose John Adams, the possibility of a nonpart) constitutional system disappeared. The framers of the Constitution did not anticipate that political parties would run competing candidates for both the presidency and the vice presidency They assumed that, of those running for president, the candidate with the most electoral votes would win and the second highest would become vice president. But Hamiltun ever the intriguer, disliked both Adams and Jefferson. He tried to manipulate tie electoral vote so that the Federalist vice-presidential candidate, Thomas Pinclcnev of South < airolina, would In- elected president. Hamilton attempted to persuade several Federalist electors to vote for Pinckney blit not Adams: the scheme backfired vvlien some of Adams' supporters learned of the plan and refused to vote for Pinckney In the ensuing confusion, Adams won with 71 electoral votes, and his rival. Jefferson, gained the vice presidency with fiS votes. The fault line between the two parties reflected basic- div isions in American life Geographically, the Federalists were strongest in New England, with its strong commercial tics to Great Britain and its powerful tradition of hierarchy and order. Moving farther south, the party became progressively weaker. Of the southernmost states, the Federalists enjoyed significant strength only in aristocratic South Carolina The Republicans won solid support in subsistence ureas like the West, where Cri-w- coeur's farmers were only weaklv linked to the market. The middle states, with more complicated economic and social divisions, were closelv contested, although the most cosmopolitan and eonunercialh oriented elements remained the core of Federalist strength. The Republicans won over most of the old Anti-Federalist opponents of tin- Constitution, as well as some Americans who had lirinly backed the new union. These- supporters included some commercial farmers in die North and planters in the South and. increasingly. urban workers and small shopkeeiiers who were repelled by the aristocratic tone ol the Federalists. In towns that were rising economicallv. tin Republicans were often led by ambitious men ol new wealth who felt excluded by the entrenched Federalist elite. For similar reasons Jefferson attracted the support of immigrants from France and Ireland, who felt culturally excluded, as well as tncin- Iters ol religious sects such as the Baptists and Methodists, who resented the power and privileges of New England's established Congregational church. Federalist and Republican Ideologies In different wavs, each part) looked both forward and back: toward certain traditions of the past as well as toward newer social currents that would shape America in the nineteenth century. Most Federalists view ed themselves as a kind of natural aristocracy making a last desperate stand against the excesses of democracy. They clung to the notion that a nation's political and social leaders should be identical, lliat the upper class should rule over their social and economic inferiors. In supporting the established social order, most Federalists opposed unbridled individualism.

The Miieri- can representatives refused. When details of these discussions became public, a tremendous outcry against France ensued. Confronted with such deeply fell anger. Federalist leaders saw a chance* to retain power by exploiting the national emergency and going to war with France. With war fever running high. Congress in 170$ repudiated the French treaty of 177$, authorized 40 ships lor a newly created Department of the Navy, and enlarged the army to 12,500 men. Hepublicans suspected that the puqxise of the army was not to light the French army none existed in North America—but to crush tin* opjxisition party and establish a military despotism. All that remained was for Adams to whip up popular feeling and lead the nation into war. But Adauis hesitated, afraid he would become a scapegoat if his policies failed Furthermore, lie distrusted standing armies and preferred the navy as the nation's Tin primary defense. So an nnollirial naval war broke out -the so-called Quasi-War- as Quasi-War ships in each navy openlv and freeh raided tin- fleets of the other, while Britain continued to impress American sailors and seize ships susp'eted of trading with France. Hamilton, still eager for war. took the lead in getting Congress to enlarge the army. Ile dreamed ol seizing Louisiana and Florida, which were held Itv France's alls Spain, as a way to make Hit' arms acceptable to the American people. I lumilton even toyed with the idea of inarching through Virginia in order to provoke resistance anil justify suppression ol the lU-publican party. Urging that Virginia be put "to the test of resistance." he disclosed that he was ready to use tin* arms to subdue a refnrloni iiihI ptneerful State *' But Hamilton's hot-headed behavior helped cool Adams' martial ardor. The president delayed accepting enlistments and commissioning officers, and the new army never reached more than a third its authorized size. Moreover, the British deleal ol the French licet in 179$ ended am threat ol French invasion and with it the necessity' of the army. Suppression at Home Before the threat of war had diminished, however. Federalist leaders attempted hi suppress disloyalty at home. In the summer of 179$ Congress passed several hum- Alien mul sures known together as the Alien and Sedition Acts.

To cries tliat such censorship violated the First Amendment's gnar- antees of freedom ofsjieech and the press. Federalists replied that sedition anti libel were nnt protected hv the Constitution. Because of die heavy-handed way it was enftircetl, the Sedititm Act tjuickh became a symbol of ty ranny. Federalists promptly convicted and imprisonetl a nnin- lier of prominent Republican eilitt>rs. Several Republican papers ceased publication, and the act even brought to justice one unfortunate tippler who had proclaimed his fervent hope tliat a cannonball might hit the president in his rear. In all, 25 were urrested under the law anti 1(1 convicted and imprisoned, including Matthew' I .von, a Republican mendicr of Congress from Vermont. Unpopular by any measure, the Sedition Act became doubly obnoxious because Federalists used it in such a partisan mumier. The crisis over the Sedition Act forced Republicans to develop a broader eon- ivption of freedom of the press. Previously, most Americans had agreed that newspapers should not be restrained before publication, but that they could be punished afterward lor libel. JelTcrson and others now argued that (lie American government was unitjuelv based on the free expression of public opinion—not just in elections rvm two vears, but in continuous discussion and debate. Criticism of the government was not a sign of criminal intent Only overtlv seditious acts, not opinions, should he subject to prosecution. The courts eventually adopted this view, although liner in power the Republicans did not hesitate to prosecute Federalist editors for libel, especially in the state courts. The Supreme Court settled the issue in ( nitetl Frredtmi of the /ires* Virginia anil Kentucky resolutions Federalist split Jefferson 's election States v. Hudson and Goodwin (1812). ruling that there was no such crime as seditious libel under the Constitution. The decision heralded a new. more absolute view of freedom of speech guaranteed bv the First Amendment. Meanwhile, however, the Republican-controlled legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky responded to the crisis of 179S bv each passing a set of resolutions. Written secretly b) Madison for Virginia and Jefferson for Kentucky, they developed the doctrine of state interposition. The Constitution, they claimed, was a compact between sovereign states, which delegated strictly limited powers to the federal government. When the government exceeded those limits and threatened the liberties of citizens, states had the right to inter] rose their authority. The logical conclusion of this reasoning was that the states, and not the federal courts, had the authority to decide whether the federal government had exceeded its power. But Jefferson and Madison were not ready to rend a union that had so recent!v been forged. They hoped the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions would rails public opinion to the Republican cause, but they did not encourage Virginia or Kentucky to resist federal authority by force. And other states openly rejected the doctrine. During the hist year of the Adams administration, the Alien and Sedition Acts quietly expired. Once in power, the Republicans repealed the Naturalization Act. The Election of 1S00 With a naval war raging on the high seas and the Alien and Sedition Acts sparking debate at home. Adams suddenly shocked his party by reopening negotiations with France. It was a courageous act. for Adams not only split his party in two, hut also mined his own chances lor reelection by forcing Hamilton's pro-British wing of the party into open opposition. Yet the nation as a whole benefited, for France signed a peace treaty ending its undeclared war. Adams, who bristled with pride and independence. termed this act "the most disinterested, the most determined and the most successful of my whole life." With the Federalist party split. Republican prospects for 1800 brightened Again the party chose Jefferson to run against Adams, along with Aaron Burr for vice president. Their efficient party organization mobilized supporters, helped fund Republican newspapers, and circulated the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions ;ls propaganda. In contrast, the Federalists' highhanded policies and disdain for the "mob" doomed them in a republic where so many citizens could vote. The political journalist Noah Webster put his finger on his fellow Federalists' problem when lie said: "They have attempted to resist the force of public opinion, instead of falling into the current with a view to direct it." Sweeping to victors, the Republicans won control of both houses ol Congress for the first time, gaining 40 seats from the Federalists in the House alone. Jefferson outdistanced Adams. 73 electoral votes to 65, although Adams ran ahead of other Federalists on the ticket. But once again the election demonstrated the fragilits of the fledgling political system. Jefferson anil Burr received an equal numlier of votes but the Constitution, with no provision for political parties, did not distinguish he tween the votes lor president and vice president. With the election tied, the decision lav with the House of Representatives, where each state was allotted one vote. Since Burr refused to step aside for Jefferson, the election remained deadlocked for almost a week, until the Federalists, who eventually decided that Jefferson represented the lesser of two evils, allowed his election on the thirty-sixth ballot. In 1804 the Twelfth plates, bolting the food down in complete silence. In America, insisted one disgruntled European, foocl was "pitch-forked down." Horatio Greenough, a sculptor who returned to the United States in 1836 after an extended stay abroad, was amazed and a hit frightened by the pace that confronted him. "Go ahead! is the order of the day," he- observed. "The whole continent presents a scene of scrambling and roars with greedy hurry." If the economic hallmark of this new order was the growth of a national market, there were social factors that also contributed to the new', restless America. Population Growth Riving The American pipulation continued to double about every 22 years—more than po))ulalion twice the birth rate of Great Britain. The census, which stood at few'er than 4 million in 1790. surpassed 9 million in 1820. By IS-50, 23 million people lived in the United States. Although the birth rate peaked in 1.300, it declined only slowly before 1S4R in the 1840s. a period of rapid urbanization, it dropped about 10 percent, the first significant decrease in American history. (See "Generations of the Republic: Families of the New Democracy," pages 448-451.) In cities, couples tended to be older at marriage and families were smaller, in part because the labor of children was not as critical to the family's welfare. At the same time, many basic population characteristics changed little throughout the first half of the nineteenth century. Life expectancy did not improve significantly, the population remained quite young, and mariying young anti quickly' shirting a family remained the norm, especially in rural areas. From 1790 to 1820 natural increase accounted for virtually all of the country's population growlb. But immigration, which had been disrupted bv the NajHiIeonk Wars in Europe, revived after 1815. In the 1830s some 600,000 immigrants arrived more than double the number in the quarter century after 1790. This increase wit merely a foretaste ol the flood of newcomers that reached America beginning in dilate 1840s The vast areas of land available for settlement absorbed much of the burgeoning population. "Old America seems to be breaking up, and moving westward." one English visitor declared in 1817. Bv 1850 almost half of the American population lived outside the original 13 states, and well over 2 million lived beyond the Mississippi River. Tin- population west of the Appalachian Mountains doubled between 1810 and 1820, and again the following decade. By 1840. more than one American m three lived in the trans-Appalachian West. The Federal Lund Kush Ijiiul salts As the tide of settlers pushed w'est, the federal government avidly encouraged them In the great prosperity after 1815. speculation in western lands reached frenzied proportions as the government sold land on credit. Whereas in 1800 only 68.000 acres of the public domain had been sold, 1.3 million acres were sold in 1815, mostly to speculators, ami in 1818 sales peaked at a staggering 3.5 million acres, an ar" larger than the state of Connecticut. In llie depression that followed beginning in 1819, speculators were ruined, and many farmers lost their farms. Congress reacted by abolishing credit sales and demanding payment in cash, but it tempered this policy bv lowering the price of the cheapest lands from $2.00 an acre to S1.2-5. T!ir best lands, sold at auction, fetched considerably higher prices, however.) It also Tlit* average "mill girl." as thex were called, was between lfi and 30 years old Most were not working to support their families back home on the farm; instead they wanted to accumulate some money for perhaps the first time in their li es, to sample some of life's pleasures, ami to save for a marriage dowry. "I must . . . have something of my own before many more years have passed." Sails Rice wrote when her parents asked her to return home to Somerset, Vermont. "And where is that something coming from if 1 go home and earn nothing? ... 1 have but one life to live and I want to enjoy myself as well as I can." Uke Rice, few women in the mills intended to work permanently. Most stayed no more than five years before marrying, taking up housekeeping, and raising a family. Mill workers often quit periodically to return home, then came back and resumed work. These interruptions from the tedious routine, the sens*' of sisterhood that united women in the boardinghouses, and their view of the situation as temporary rather than permanent, all made it easier for farm daughters to adjust to the stress and regimen tin- factory imposed on them. Mary Paul went to work in the Lowell mills in November 1845 at the age of 15. The daughter of a rural New England family, she was working as a domestic servant when she asked her father lor permission to go to laiwell. "1 am in need of clothes which I cannot get about here," she explained, "and for that reason I want to go to Lowell or some other place." Two friends from her hometown of Barnard, Vermont, helped her find her first job, from which she earned S12S in 11 months; apparently slie did not send any of it back to her father. After four years she returned home, but now found the "countiyfied" stvle too confining and eventually left again. During the next seven years, she moved about and supported hersell in several occupations, until at age 27 she married the son of a former l/vwell boardinghouse keeper Marx- Paul's urban experiences hail altered her outlook. Like the majority of mill workers traced in one study, she did not return to farm life, settling down instead in nearby Lynn, where her husband got a job in the marble works. As competition in the textile industry intensified, factory managers undertook to raise productivity. In the mid* 1830s die mills began to increase the workloads. The most commonly used methods were the speed-up (increasing the speed of the ma- chines). the stretch-out (increasing the number of machines each operator tended), ami the premium system (paying Ixmuses for high productivity). Skilled women Could make more money under the new sx'stem. but they had to work much harder to do so. The average worker's productivity rose b\- 71 percent, but her wages went up unlv lfi percent. Even these changes in work rules failed to maintain previous profits, ami on several occasions factories cut wages. The decline of paternalism and the ever-quickening pace ol xx'ork finally provoked resistance among the women in the mills. Several times in the 1830s wage cuts sparked strikes in which a minority of workers walked out. Management retaliated bv firing strike loaders, hiring new workers, and blacklisting women who refused to return. In the 1840s workers' protests focused on the demand for a 10-honr day. Perhaps a third of the female workers signed petitions calling for the shorter workday, hut the legislature, siding with the owners, concluded that working conditions acre not the state's responsibility. As the mills expanded, a smaller proportion of the workers lived in company boardinghouses and moral regulations were relaxed. But the greatest change was a shift in the work force from native-born lemales to Irish immigrants. The Irish, who had comprised onlx S percent of the !/>well work force in 1845, made up almost half br I860. In addition. 30 percent of the workers were men. and the number of Female workers Transformat it m of Lowell 362 THE ItITl ISJ.Il TRANSFORMED VXD TESTED ehildre-n in the mills (many of whom also were Irish) doubled. The arrival of t In- Irish. who were desperately poor and did not view their situation as tcmporan'. signaled the creation of a |H'rmanent working class It also eventually led Jo a lowering of wages and a narrowing of the gup between the highest and lowest [raving jobs in the factory. The founding vision of Izwcll had vanished. Industrial Work Artisan system Transformation of u-ork Tile transition to an industrial lalror force with values and behavior patterns that were attuned to factory work was not a smooth one. Before the rise of the factory artisans had worked within the home. Apprentices were considered part of the family and subject to the discipline and control ol the master. Masters were responsible not onlv for teaching their apprentices a trade, but also for providing them some education and for supervising their moral behavior. Journeymen took pride in their work, knowing that if they developed their skills and were frugal, thev could eventually set l hem selves up in a shop and become respected master artisans. Nor did skilled craftsmen work In the clock, at a steady pais1. Imt rather in bursts of intense lalxir alternating with slow seasons, their w ork frequently interrupted for a pint ol ale, a hit of gossip, or ev en a prank or two. The factory changed that. Pride in craftsmanship gave way to rates ol productivity. Goods produced by factories were not as finished or elegant as those done by hand At the same time that workers lost pride in their work, they were required to discard old habits. Industrialism demanded a worker who was sober, dependable, and self-disciplined. The machines, whirring and clacking away, set a strict schedule that had to lie followed Absenteeism, lateness, and drunkenness hurt productivity and. since work was specialized, disrupted the regular factory routine. Thus industrialization not only produced a fundamental change in the way work was organized. It transformed the v ery nature of work. The first generation to experience these changes did not adopt the new attitudes easily . The factors clock lx*came the symbol ol the new work rules. One mill worker who finally' quit complained revealingly alxnit "obedience to the ding-dong of the hell - just as though we are so many living machines." With the loss of personal freedom also came the loss of pride in one's work and a sense of place in the community. Unlike the master—apprentice relationship, factories sharply separated workers from management, few workers rose through the ranks to supervisory pillions. In areas of the economy where facton production became dominant, even fewer could achieve the artisan's dream of setting up one's own business, since handcrafted goods were too expensive to l>c sold to any hut the wealthy. Even well- paid workers sensed their decline in status. The* Shoe Industry Shoemakiiig illustrates one wav the artisan tradition came to be undermined. Ii lj/nn Iziwcll was the symbol of the textile industry, nearby Lvnn was the center of shoe manufacturing. Traditionally, a skilled cobbler possessed a good knowledge of leather, had (he abilitv to cut out tin* various parts of a shoe, and could stitch anil alnr those parts together. He then sold the shoes in the* same shop where lie and Im apprentices made them. Unlike the textile industry', shocniakiiig was not rapitlk transformed bv a shift to heavy machinery.

The unsettling economic, social, and political changes of the Jacksonian era heightened white Americans' fear of failure, stimulating racism. The popular yet unrealistic expectation was that any'white man might become rich; yet in fact. 20 to 40 percent of white adult males during tliis period never accumulated any property . Their lar k of success encouraged them to relieve personal tensions through increased hostility to their black neighbors. Subjecting blacks to legal disabilities ensured that even the poorest whites would enjoy an advantage in the race for wealth and static "The prejudice of race appears to Ih- stronger in the states that have ulmlishcd slavery than in those where it still exists," Toequeville noted, "and nowhere is it so intolerant as in those states where servitude has never been known." Racism, whether directed against African-Americans or Indians, offered whites a relnge from the frustrations of uncertain status in a supposedly egalitarian society The power of racism in Jacksonian America stemmed in part, at least, from the lad that equality remained part of the nation's creed, while it steadily receded as a social reality.

Garrison even boasted that iIh- genius of the abolitionist movement is to have no plan." Abolitionism demonstrated the severe limits of Emersonian self-reliance as a solution to deeply rooted smul problems. Ihfitnn enters politics Tile crusading idealism of revivalists and reformers inevitably collided with the him! reality that society could not be perfected by converting indiv iduals. Several campaigns including those to establish public schools and erect asylums, had operated within the political system from the beginning. A growing miniher of other frustmlul reformers abandoned the principle of voluntary persuasion and looked to governmental eoereion to achieve their goals. In America's democratic society, politics promised a more effective means to impose a new moral vision on the nation. I)e- clarcd a writer in the American Temperance Magazine, 'The speculative has yielded to the practical. In this sense, moral suasion is moral balderdash." Politicians did not particularly welcome the new interest. Because tin1 Whig uni! Democratic parties had formed around economic questions rather than moral mia both drew on evangelical and nonevangelical voters. Yd it was precisely fur tliki reason that moral questions such as temperance and antislaverv threatened todrUdi regular party memliers and disrupt each party's miitx and voting base. Both religion and reform helped shape that svstem through ethnic and religima lovalticv Whigs attracted immigrant groups that most easily merged into the dnak limit culture, such as the English, Welsh, and Scots. Democrats, on the other band Till T1HITS OF PEHFECTION1SM +43 wcruited more Germans and Irish, whose drinking habits. more lenient oliservance ofllie Sabbath, and (among Catholics) use of parochial schools made native-born citizens suspicions. As the self-prrxTaimed party of respectability , Whigs es|x-ciallittracted the support of high-status native-born church groups, including the Con- gutiunalists and Unitarians in New England and Presbyterians elsewhere. Democrats appealed to the lower-status baptists and Methodists, both parties also attracted freethinkers and the unchurched, but the Democrats had the advantage cause thev resisted demands for temperance and Sabbatarian laws, such as the tihitiou of Sunday' travel. Women and the Right to Vote .As the focus of change and reform shifted toward the militical arena, women in particular lost influence. As major participants in the benevolent organizations of the lK20s and 1830s, the)' had used their efforts on behalf of "moral suasion," But since women eotdd not vote, they fell excluded when reformers turned to electoral action to accomplish their goals. B\ the IS4(ls lemale reformers increasingly demanded the right to vote as the means to reform society-'. Nor were men blind to what was at Ur: one reason thev so strongly resisted female suffrage was beeuuse it would give TOiiirn real power. The temperance and almlitionist movements. both of which turned to political jrtion in the 1840s. helped comince women of the importance of gaining the ballot, hrviouslv many female reformers had accepted the right of petition as their most ropriatc political activ ity . But Tin Lilt/, a women's rights paper, soon changed its "Why shall |wumen] lie left only the [>oor resource of petition?" it asked. "For even petitions, when they are Irom women, without the elective franchise to give them backbone, are of hut little consequence.''

As ark as 1325 Ly man Beecher had called for banning the sale of distilled spirits, and the unti)i<|ii(ir crusade turned to |X)litical action in the 1840s. Although drinking had ificantly declined in American society , it had not been eliminated. After 1845 the al of large numlx'rs of German and Irish immigrants, who were accustomed to liking, made voluntary prohibition even more remote. In response, temperance Vacates decided to attack Hie supply of liquor by enacting state laws outlawing the ufacturc and sale of alcoholic beverages. Vntiliquor reformers reasoned that if tor was unavailable, the attitude of drinkers was unimportant they would be nl to reform whether thev wanted to or not. In taking up the cause of prohibition, the antidrinking movement gained the art of the ev angelical churches, which condemned drinking even in moderation. Consequently. the issue of prohibition cut across party lines, with large numbers of Whigs and Democrats on both sides of the question. When parts leaders tried to Ige the issue, the temperance movement adopted the strategy of endorsing for the slattire candidates who pledged to support a prohibitory' law.

Separating themselves from the working class, these families consciously reduced the nuiulter of children in order to increase their own standard of living and improve their children's prospects for success, The birth rate was higher among immigrants and working-class families, who spent less money on education and sent children to work at an earlier age, but it also gradually declined.

The ideal of the democratic family that developed after 1SIK) was based on greater I personal affection, not only lx1 tween Ims- liand aiul wife, but also between parents awl children. The new family was child- ifljotered: relations with children were emotionally less distant and—as Murrvat o!>- served—discipline was less severe. Children Were seen as individuals with s|X'iial needs, and companies lx*gan producing lxxiks. toys, and furniture designed specifically for them. By midcentuiy the concept of the tamilv vacation had developed, along with new family-oriented celebrations such as Christmas, Thanksgiving, and birthilay parties. With fewer children, mothers could lavish more attention on each child. Anxious about raising their sons and daughters properly. women read a host of books on child nurture directed specifically at them. Whereas the Puritan tradition bail stressed the "breaking and beating down" of a chilli's "natural pride." nineteenth-century parents emphasized the importance of affection rather than strict control. The new generation of children also tended to remain at home longer. Eigli- teenth-century parents had put out older children as apprentices and servants in order to reduce their financial burden, hut families now delayed their children's departure in order to extend their education and increase their chances of success. A growing number of children, especially among the urban middle class, lived at home until their late teeus and even earlv twenties. Adolescence (a term that now came into common use) was recognized as a separate stage of life, distinct from childhood, witli its own needs anil problems.

Gigantic bcixls of cattle and irrigated fields wire tended bv about 20.000 Indians, nominally converted to tin* Christian faith. who worked for all practical purposes as slaves. In 1834 the missions' holdings included 400.000 cattle. 300,000 sheep and swine, and 60,000 horses. When Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821. California at first war little affected. But as the Mexican Congress began carrying out reforms, it freed lie Indians of California in 1833 and stripped the Catholic church of its lands. TW were turned over to Mexican cattle ranchers, usually in massive grants of •'50.000 acres or more. The new mneherm ruled their estates much like great planters of tbr antebellum South. Lalror was presided bv Indians, who once again were form! to work for little more than room and lroard. Indeed, the mortality rate ol litclijj workers was twice that of southern slaves and four times that of the Mexican t diiur- uians. The ranclwros lived in as much ease and comfort as their isolated existence allowed. At this time the Mexican population of California was approximately 4000 Bv the 1820s and 1830s Yankee traders were sailing around South America and up the Pacific to California, where the1 ships moved up and down the coast trading for dried hides and tallow. When their holds were full they set sail lor home. As ranchers hegan to play off rived merchants, the Yankees established their own agents in (jli- fortiia to buy hides vear-round and store them in warehouses until a company ship arrived. These agents were the first Americans to settle- permanently in California and their glowing letters home lured others west. Still, in 1843 the* American popula- tiihi amounted to only TOO. Spanish settlement ol New Mexico was more dense: the province had almiit 44.000 inhabitants in 1827. But like California, its soc iety was dominated by murium families who grazed large herds of sheep along the upper Kio Grande valley between FI Paso and Taos. A few individuals controlled most ol the wealth, while their workers eked out a meager living. Mining of copper and gold was also important, and here too, the- profits enriched a small upper class. Spain had long outlawed any commerce with Americans, hut in 1821 several traders from Missouri ventured forth, returning: with the news (as one ingenious speller phrased it) that "the* mackeson (Mexican} province lias de (.'lured Independence of the mother Cuntry and is desiruus ofi traid With the people ol the- united States." Soon yearly caravans were making tie long jonrnev along the Santa Fe Trail, handing together for safety in a single wagmi train.

"'I'liere is an excitement connected with tile pursuit <>r gold which renders one restless and uneasy—ever hoping to do something better,'* explained one forty-niner. Removed from the traditional forms of social control, miners engaged in gambling swearing, drinking, and lighting. As a Denver paper complained during that territory's gold rush a few years later, as soon ;is "men of decent appearance" reached a mining camp, they "sang low songs, walked tijienh' with the painted courtesans with whom the town teems, and generalh gave themselves up to what they term, 'a time! " Secure in the knowledge that "their women folks were safe and snug in their distant homes. . . these [former) gentlemen announced that they were going The whole hog or none.'" Onh almut 5 [vercent ol gold rush emigrants were women or children; given this relative scarcity, men were willing to pax top dollar for women's domestic skills. Women supported themselves by cooking, sewing, and washing, as well as by running hotels and boarding houses. "A smart woman can do very well in this countryone woman informed a friend in the East. It is the only country 1 ever was in where a woman received anything like a just compensation for work." Women's wages declined with time, hut even so, they suffered no shortage of suitors. "I had men come (arty miles oxer tin* mountains, just to look at me," Eli/a Wilson recalled, "and I never was called a handsome woman, in my (test days, even by my most ardent .ulmirers." Women went to 11 it■ mining frontier to be with their husbands, to make money, or to lind adventure lix far the class most frequently seen in the diggings wen- prostitutes, who numbered perhaps 2tl percent ol female Californians in 1850.

In such circumstances life was grim, violent, and uncertain. Predictably, mining the miners offered one of the more reliable roads to pros- prritx. Perhaps half the inhabitants of a mining town were shopkeepers, businesspeo- ple, and professionals who serviced prospectors. Also conspicuous were gamblers, card sharks, and other outcasts, all bent on separating the miner from bis riches. In srnli an atmosphere, violence was prevalent, so when a new camp opened, miners adopted a set of rules anil regulations. Justice xx;us dispensed promptly, either In a wteof all the miners or by an elected jury. After xx finessing one such trial, a European visitor commented, "I ncxer saw a court ol justice xxith so little humbug about n While elfectixe when administered fairly, the system at times degenerated into lynch law.

That was still higher than eastern wages, but goods and services cost significantly more too. As gold became increasingly difficult to extract, companies using heavy equipment and employing miners working for wages came to dominate the industry. Thus control ol the mining industry passed into the hands of capitalists and corporate executives. Men who had come to California filled with visions of wealth usually found only shovels of mud And a* the era of the individual miner passed, so too did mining camps and the unique society they spawned. Instant City: San Francisco When the United States assumed control of California, San Francisco had a population of perhaps 200. But thousands of emigrants took the water route west, passing through San Francisco's harbor on their way to the diggings. By 1850 the cites population had jumped to an astonishing 50,000. In a mere eight years the city had attained the size New York had taken 190 years to reach. San The product of economic self-interest, San Francisco developed in a helter- Fmucisca's skelter fashion. I .and prices soared, speculation was rampant, and commercial forces rhaottr became paramount.

In 1860 the cits was 50 percent foreign-born. The most distinctive of the ethnic groups was the Chinese. They had come to Cum San, the land of the golden mountain. Irecause China in the 1840s had experienced considerable economic distress Between 1S49 and 185-1. some 45,000 Chinese went to California. Like the other gold seekers, they were overwhelmingly jnung and male, and they wanted only to ........date savings and return home to their families. (Indeed, only 10 Chinese women were recorded as arriving before 1854.) When the Chinese were harassed in the mines, many found work in San Francisco as launderers. The going rate at the time for washing, ironing, and starching Aiits was an exorbitant $8 per dozen. Many early San Franciscans actually found it cheaper to send their dirty laundry to Canton or Honolulu, to he returned several months later. The Chinese quieklv stepped in, for it took little capital to start a laundry—soap, scnih board, iron, and ironing board. Soon the price for washing tots dropjxtl to 82 a dozen. Other Chinese around San Francisco set up restaurants I or worked in the fishing industry. In these early years thev found Americans less hostile, so long as thes stayed asvas from the gold lie-ids. In 1850 a San Francisco newspaper, the Alla California, predicted optimistic-alls that "the China Bos s ssill yet Chinese experience vote at tliv same polls, study at the same schools and !k>w at the sain<' altaras mir countrymen." As immigration and the competition lor jobs increased, however, anti- Chinese sentiment intensified. Crailuallv. San Francisco took on the trappings til a more orderly community.

The only exceptions were iron and uiachliirrv. Industrial growth also spurted during the 1850s as water power was increasingly replaced hv steam. Since there were only a fixed number of watcr-jxiwer site--, tor industry to spread another source of power was essential. Most important, tin- factory system of organizing lalror and the technology of interchangeable parts spread to other areas of the economy. Many industries during the 1850s adoptetl interchangeable purts. Isaac Singer began using them in I S3! in mass produce sewing machines, an invention patented only five years earlier. In turn, sewing machines made possible the ready-made clothing industry, while shoe manufacturers adapted the machines to concentrate all steps of their production under a single roof. Similarlx. the workers who assembled farm implements performed i single step in the process over and over again. B\ I860 the United States had nearly j billion dollars invested in manufacturing, almost twice as much as in 1849. Immigration The surge of industry depended oil having a large labor force to support the faetnrx system. Natural increase helped swell the population to more than 30 million bv I860, but this accounted for only part of the new' labor force, for the hirth rate in the Uniter 1 States had actually begun to decline.

Immigration reached its highest levels during peri* mb nf prosperitv then declinetl signiiicunth after 1857, when the country entered mother depression. Whether traveling as individuals or its families, most of the ncw- tntners were voung people in the prime of life: in I85ti out of 224.000 arrivals, only 31.000 were under 10 and 20.(XK) were over 40. Certainly the booming economy and the lure of freedom drew immigrants to America, but they were also pushed hv deteriorating conditions in Europe. In Ire- Lmi, a jxitato lilight in I S ift produced widespread famine. Already desperately ]x>or and oppressed bv English landlords, the Irish faced hunger, starvation, and the rav- .gts of epidemics that swept across the Emerald Isle. Out of a population of 9 million, as inanv as a million perished, while a million and a half more emigrated, hvn-thirds to the United States. The tide continued, though at a lesser rate, even after the potato crop recovered in 1819. The Irish tended to be poorer than other immigrant groups of the day. The newcomers were generally vuunger sons and daughters of rural families, who had become a burden to their families because Irish farms were so small. Mostly unmar- Irinl, they often arrived as individuals rather than as part of a family, and they sent money home to support their relatives. Although the Protestant Seoteh-Irish continued to emigrate, as so many hail during the eighteenth century, the decided majority ul the Irish who came after 1845 wen* Catholic. Because they were pixir and milled. the Irish congregated in the cities, where the women performed domestic voile and took factors' jobs and the men did manual labor. Germans and Scandinavians also had economic reasons for leaving Europe.

An approving Dutch woman reported that schools were .taxes low. and because "the finely is great, one cannot discern any difference brlween the cobbler's wife and the wile of a prominent gentleman." Although many Germans and Scandinavians arrived in modest straits, few were ih impoverished, and many could afford to buv a farm or start a business.

Mostl) Irish, they found that American employers gave them only the lower paving jobs and excluded them from company housing. Tensions between native- and foreign-born workers, as well as among immigrants of various nationalities, made it dillicult for workers to unite. The sizable foreign-born population in many American cities severely strained their resources. Immigrants who could barely make ends meet were forced to live in overcrowded, indicated tenement houses, damp cellars, and even shacks. Touring a typical tenement, one New York journalist reported that "Hie hall was dark and reeking with the worst tilth. . . The upper part oi the house was filled with little narrow rooms, each one having five or six occupants; all very filths. The people seemed very poor, honest Irish, not long here, and without work, usually." Sudi urban slums became notorious for crime and drinking, which took a heavy toll on families and the poor. In the eves of many native-born Americans, immigrants weir to blame for driving down factors wages and pushing American workers out of jobs Overarching these complaints was a fear that America might not he able to assimilate the new groups, with their unfamiliar social customs, strange languages, national pride, and foreign traditions. Such fears precipitated an outburst of political nativwn in the mid- 1850s. .Southern Complaints With British and northern factories buying cotton in unprecedented quantities, southern planters prospered in the 1850s, Like those ol northern commercial fann- ers, their operations became more highly capitalized to keep up with the demand. But northern capital went into machinery like McCormick's harvester: white southerners invested in slaves. During the 1850s. the price of prime held hands readied record lev-els at New Orleans and other southern markets. Still, a number of southern nationalists, who advocated that the South should hr a separate nation, pressed for greater industrialization to make the region more independent. "At present, the North fattens and grows rich iijhui the South.' mx.- Alabama newspaper complained in 1851. We purchase all our luxuries and necessities from the North. . . .

The a that the South was a colons of the North was inaccurate, but southerners found it a convincing explanation of the North's growing wealth. More important, it rein- 'd their resistance to federal aid for economic development, which they were vinced would inevitahlv enrich the North at southern expense. This attitude fur- weakened the South's political alliance with the West, which needed federal aid transportation. White southerners also feared that the new tide of immigration would shift the anal balance of power. Immigrants did settle in the South's lew cities (in I860 v Orleans' white population was 44 percent foreign-horn), and some German •rs settled in Texas. But for the most part immigrants shunned the South Ih-- thev did not want to compete with cheap slave labor. The lack of industry and limited demand for skilled lalx"r also shunted immigrants northward. As a result. j: >5?

Its members were sworn to secrecy ami instructed to answer inquiries h\ replying "I know noth- in? In 1853 the Know-Nothings (its they were quickly*dubbed) began organizing in several other states: after only a year they had become the fastest growing parts in the nation. Not coincidentally. 1S.54 also marked the jieak of the new wave of immigration. Taking xs its slogan "Americans should rule America," the American parts advocated that immigrants be forced to wait not 5 but 21 years before becoming natural| iml citizens.

John Brown's enduring legacy sprang not from his ill-conceived raid but from tile popular reaction to his cause. With the election of 1860 looming and victory seemingly within their grasp. Republicans denounced Brown's raid as "the gravest of crimes." But other northerners were less cautious. Ralph Waldo Emerson described Brown as a "saint, whose martyrdom will make the gallows as glorious as the cross." and on the dav of his execution, church bells tolled in mans northern cities. Onlv a minority of northerners endorsed Brown, but southerners wen1 shocked by such publ ic displays of sympathy. And they were firmly convinced that the Republican party was secretly connected to tin* raid. The legislatures of Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida all passed resolutions declaring that the election of a Republican president would justify secession. "I have idways been a fervid Union man, one North Oimlina resident wrote, "but I confess the endorsement of the Harpers Ferry outrage has shaken my fidelity and 1 am willing to take the chances of every probable evil that may arise from disunion, sooner than submit any- longer to Northern insolence and Northern outrage." A Sectional Election When Congress convened in Decern I kt. only three days after John Brown was executed. there were ominous signs everywhere of the growing sectional rift Intent on tniying Douglas' Freeport Doctrine, southern radicals in Congress issued a platform for the I 860 election that demanded a federal slave code to protect slavery in tin.1 territories. To northern Democrats, such a platform spelled political death. As one Indiana Democrat put it. "We cannot carry a single congressional district on that doctrine in the state." The Democratic convention met in April in Charleston, South Carolina. Qttvred on In the packed galleries, southern radicals boldly pressed their demand fora federal slave code as a way to force Douglas out of the race. An angry Senator George Buglt of Ohio spoke for the Douglas forces: "Gentlemen of the South, you mistake us.—you mistake ns. We will not do it." After six days of heated debate, the ivention adopted the Douglas platform upholding popular sovereignty, whereupon the delegations from die entire Deep South, plus Arkansas, walked out. Unable to agree on a candidate, the convention adjourned to reassemble two months later in timore. There, Douglas was nominated, but most of the remaining southern locraLs left in disgust. Joining with the Charleston seeeders, they nominated r own candidate, Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, on a platform irting a federal slave code. The hist major national part)' had shattered. In May the Republicans convened in Chicago. In the end. the delegates turned Abraham I .incoin, who could help carry his doubtful home state of Illinois. Lin- n was a moderate on slavery and acceptable to all factions of the party, including the Ormans and the former Know-Nothings. Republicans also sought to broaden their appcul by adding to their platform several economic planks that endorsed a ierately protective tariff, a homestead hill, and a northern transcontinental rail- toad The election that followed was really two contests in one In the North, which Reaction to the mid Disruption of the Democratic fuirtij FiimlatiU'htal ixotioiiiic changes heightened sectional tensions in the 1850s. The stmetion ol a vast railroad network during this decade reoriented western trade from the South to the Ernst, and the large influx of immigrants, who provided cheap Wwr for the rising factories of the North, swelled the North's population (and hence its political power! at the expense of the South, therein stimulating southern fears. In addition, the parts system realigned in this decade along sectional lines. The iwtivist movement precipitated by the arrival of so many immigrants and Catholics, iu conjunction with the reimigoration of the slavery expansion issue following passage of the Kansas Nebraska Act in 1854. shattered the Jacksonian parts' system. Bator Stephen A. Douglas advocated the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which lured that the |>cnple of a territory should decide the status of slavery there, as a awful solution to the question of slavery's extension. Incorporated into the isas Nebraska Act. popular sovereignty failed in the Kansas Territory, where iting sck>n broke out between proslavery and antislavery partisans. Sectional vio- e reached a climax in May 1856 with the attack on Lawrence, Kansas, and the ng ol Senator Charles Sumner ol Massachusetts bv Representative Preston S. inks of South Carolina. Intensifying sectional tensions precipitated the formation a new political party —the sectional, antislavery Republican party. flic crisis between the two sections steadily worsened during the' administration James Buchanan The Supreme Court's Died Scott decision, the Panic of 1857, tlie hitler congressional struggle over tile proslavery Lecompton constitution which nred the Democratic party, and John Brown's attack on Harpers Ferry.

More than anything else, however, they reviled the draft as an attack on individual freedom and an instrument of sjxfial privilege. According to the provisions enacted in 1863. a person would In- exempt from the present (but not any future) draft by paying a commutation fee of $300. about a year's wages for a worker or an ordinary fanner. Or those drafted could hire a substitute, the cost of which was be vend the reach of all but the wealthy. Approximately 118,(MM) men did so, and another 87.000 paid the commutation fee. Perhaps another 100.000 northerners illegally evaded the draft.

In both the North and South, farmers and farm laborers accounted for the largest group of soldiers, whereas unskilled rkers. who were poorer than other groups, were actually underrepresented. Camp Life •Idlers spent most of their time in camp, perhaps as many as 50 days, on average, fur every day spent in battle The near-holiday atmosphere of the early months, when army life seemed like a gigantic campout, soon gave way to dull routine. Men from rural areas, accustomed to the freedom ol the farm, complained about the endless eurrence of reveille, roll call, and drill.

Although Grant would have won in the Electoral College even without the estimated 4)0.000 voles he received from black southerners, a majoritv of white citizens had mted for Seymour. The I SOS election helped convince Republicans that an amendment securing black suffrage throughout the nation was necessary. In February IS69 Congress sent the Fifteenth Amendment to the states for ratification. It forbade any state from denying the right to vote on grounds of race, color, or previous condition oi servitude.

The amendment was ratified in March INTO, in part with the votes of the four southern states that had not completed the process of Reconstruction and thus were also required to endorse this amendment before being readmitted to Congress. Proponents of women's suffrage were gravely disappointed when Congress refused to prohibit voting discrimination on the basis of sex as well as race.

Anthonv and Stanton, on the other hand, broke with their former allies among the Radicals, denounced the amendment, and organized the National Woman Suffrage Association to work for passage of a new amendment giving women the ballot.
