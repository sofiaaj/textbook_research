THE CLIMAX OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION
The Haymarket tragedy: Another view. This representation of what happened in Chicago in
1886 is probably more accurate than the one on page 617. It shows workers fleeing, none
firing at the police. And it shows the bomb killing both workers and the policemen who were
beating them with nightsticks. (Library of Congress)
Like most such incidents, the Hay market affair had been short. And considering
what could have happened, very few people were hurt. But it occurred on the heels
of trouble at the McCormick plant, in the midst of the strike for an eight-hour day,
w ith 80,000 Chicago workingmen off the job. Thus the Haymarket bomb touched off
a near-panic in the city and much of the rest of the nation. Thousands of respectable
citizens convinced themselves that a dangerous conspiracy of anarchists, socialists,
and communists was at work to overthrow the government and cany' out a bloody
revolution. One of the leading business magazines of the day, Bradstreets', spoke for
thousands of Americans w'hen it said of the Haymarket incident:
This week's happenings at Chicago go to show that the threats of the anarchists
against the existing order are not idle. In a time of disturbance, desperate men have
a power for evil out of proportion to their numbers. They are desperate fanatics who
are opposed to all laws. There is no room for anarchy in the political system of the
United States.
Also important was the fact that many people had been frightened and angered
by a recent flood of immigration from Europe to America—and many of the "anarch-
ists" were also foreigners. Not only in Chicago but all over the nation, newspaper
editorialists and public speakers demanded the immediate arrest and conviction of
the alien "radicals" w ho had conspired to murder honest policemen and subvert law
and order. The result was a swift and efficient series of illegal raids by the Chicago
police. They searched property without warrants. They imprisoned people without
charging them and threatened potential witnesses. All in all, the authorities arrested
and questioned about 200 "suspects"—probably none of whom had anything at all
to do with the bombing.
In this heated atmosphere, fueled by journalists who whipped up unreasonable
fears of an anarchist conspiracy', a jury met to determine w hether indictments could
be brought against anyone for the violence. It decided that although the specific person
who threw the bomb could not be identified, anyone w'ho urged violence was a
"conspirator" and was as guilty of murder as the bomb thrower. On the basis of this
decision, another jury met and indicted thirty-one persons on counts of murder. Of

up this supercorporation. Like International Har-
vester, the giant company dominated its indus-
try'. It produced almost all of some forms of steel
and three-fifths of the total steel made in the
United States.
An even more stunning example of consoli-
dation brought John D. Rockefeller into control
of the oil industry. Rockefeller started out as a
poor boy, like Carnegie. He too saved every cent
(except for the 10 percent tithe he regularly gave
to his Baptist church). Starting with one refinery
in Cleveland, Rockefeller by 1872 had created the
giant Standard Oil Company.
THE TRUST Rockefeller also created a new de-
vice that made it even easier to consolidate an
industry: the trust. A business trust is an ar-
rangement in which several companies "sell"
themselves to a group of trustees. The companies
are paid for with shares in the new trust itself.
Only paper changes hands, but the result is a
single group of directors who control the oper-
ations of several companies.
Through the Standard Oil trust, the Rockefel-
ler interests acquired almost total control of the
oil industry. The trust could phase out unnec-
essary plants. It could take full advantage of mass
production and distribution techniques to pro-
vide most of the kerosene that lighted American
lamps and the oil that lubricated American ma-
chines. Rockefeller himself summed up ade-
quately the reasons for the trust.
It has revolutionized the way of doing business
all over the world. The time was ripe for it. It
had to come, though all we saw at the moment
was the need to save ourselves from wasteful
conditions [of competition]. The day of combi-
nation is here to stay. Individualism has gone,
never to return.
One by one, the main American industries
passed from competition to consolidation. It
might occur through giant corporations created
by mergers, like International Harvester or
United States Steel. Or it might result from the
Capital and its champion. One of the favorite sub-
jects for nineteenth-century cartoonists was the trust.
Here Capital brings its newest gladiator to the edge
of the ring to introduce the victor. The vanquished at
the rear include the “small dealer" and the traveling
salesman. (Culver Pictures)
formation of trusts in various industries, from
cottonseed oil to sugar to whiskey. By 1900 a few
large concerns controlled almost all the major
facilities of production and distribution in the
United States.

agriculture, railroads, and industry demanded
millions of people—both as workers and as
consumers.
The American population kept pace with in-
dustrial growth. For every 100 people living in
the United States in 1870, there were 126 in 1880,
158 in 1890, 190 in 1900, and 230 in 1910. In one
generation, the population more than doubled,
from about 40 million in 1870 to over 90 million
fort)' years later.
These were the millions who moved into the
Great Plains and the Rockies, bringing about the
final defeat of the Native Americans. These were
the millions who made or bought McCormick's
harvesters, who built the railroads that carried
his reapers into every flat corner of the country
where grain could be planted and harvested by
machine.
SHIFTING TRENDS IN IMMIGRATION
These millions, however, were not just more of
the same kinds of Americans who had lived here
in Jacksonian times. Many of them were "new"
people—with different languages, different reli-
gions, and different ways of life. Andrew Jack-
son's "common man" was, most likely, berm in
America; he was white, Protestant, and a farmer.
His parents or grandparents might have been
immigrants, but they would probably have come
from England or Scotland. When they arrived
here, they would have found the language, the
ways of worshiping God, and the customs famil-
iar and comfortable.
But the "common man" in New York in 1900
was more likely to be a Jew from Poland or a
Catholic from Italy. He lived in a great city and
probably had a job in a factory or a business. His
English might be poor. Fiis memories of the "old
country" would be at least as important to him
as his hopes for the new. He represented a social
revolution that had accompanied the revolutions
in technology, industry, and business—-the cre-
ation of an urban immigrant working class.
There have been immigrants in America for
thousands of years, since people began to cross
over from Asia into Alaska. In the hundred years
following the American Revolution, the actual
proportion of immigrants to the total population
did not change much. Two other things hap-
pened instead. First, the nature of the immigrant
population changed. Second, the immigrants
(along with other Americans) began to congre-
gate in great urban centers. These two changes
made industrial cities like Chicago the gathering
places for a new kind of American: the poor
immigrant from a country where English was not
spoken and where an Anglo-Saxon Protestant
was a rarity.
In 1790, when the United States took its first
census under the new Constitution, nine out of
ten Americans (except for the black slaves in the
South) had English or Scottish ancestors. This
pattern changed somewhat with the immigration
of the 1840s and 1850s—the "old" immigration—
when large numbers of German, Scandinavian,
and Irish immigrants began to arrive. Although
their languages might be strange to American
ears, most of the Germans and Scandinavians
were at least Protestants. And although many
native-born Americans resented the Catholicism
of the Irish, these immigrants at least spoke En-
glish. In 1865 the United States had only about
200,000 inhabitants who had been bom in south-
ern or eastern Europe. They were easily absorbed
in a total population of about 40 million.
By 1914 this picture had changed dramati-
cally. A "new" immigration—mainly from Italy,
Russia, and Austria-Hungary—flooded into the
United States. Poverty drove many of these peo-
ple from their home countries. Some men left to
avoid the military' draft, which discriminated
against the poor. Jews wanted to escape the offi-
cial anti-Semitism of Russia and Poland. Arme-
nians fled from persecutions carried out by the
Turkish government. The new immigrants were
drawn to the United States by advertisements of
cheap steamship transportation, by rumors of
free land and golden opportunity, and by a mas-
sive propaganda campaign conducted by rail-
roads anxious for workers and for customers to
buy up their lands.

Immigration from southern and eastern Eu-
rope amounted to only a trickle in the 1860s and
1870s. But by the 1890s over half the immigrants
to America were from southern and eastern
Europe. Between 1901 and 1910—the peak dec-
ade for immigration in the history of the United
States—the proportion of new immigrants rose
to over 75 percent, as over 6 million Italians, Rus-
sian jews, Hungarians, and other immigrants
from southern and eastern Europe poured into
the country,
REACTION TO THE NEWCOMERS The
McCormick strike and the Haymarket affair
occurred just before the new immigration into the
United States reached its peak. But prejudice had
already been aroused by the entry of Irish and
Germans, and by the beginnings of the influx
from eastern and southern Europe. Both the
McCormick strike and the trial of the Haymarket
Eight occurred in an atmosphere of fear and big-
otry. The Pinkerton report on the "fighting Irish”
molders and the newspaper comments on foreign
"anarchists" make it clear that events in Chicago
would probably have been different if they had
not taken place at the time of this bewildering
flood of immigrants.
The new immigrants were not only different
in culture, language, and religion, they behaved
in ways different from those who had preceded
them. They moved into a society that was no
longer predominantly agricultural and rural, but
urban. So they did not fan out onto farms as
many of the old immigrants had done. Instead,
they followed the lead of millions of other Amer-
icans and settled into cities. Two thirds of foreign-
bom residents in the United States lived in towns
and cities by 1900.
Bewildered and often victimized in America,
new immigrants clustered together in their own
city neighborhoods, or "ghettos." People from a

particular province or even a particular village
would move into buildings on the same block,
re-creating much of the culture of their Old World
homes. As the new immigration swelled, so did
antiforeign sentiment. Ghetto dwellers earned a
reputation among "native" Americans for being
clannish, dirty, superstitious, and generally
undesirable. They were considered strange, chat-
tering in their old languages, and somehow
suited only for city life. Actually, of course, they
were no more "natural" city dwellers than were
the English who had come to Virginia and Mas-
sachusetts in the seventeenth century. They were
simply caught in a phase of the industrial revo-
lution—the creation of an urban society.
Immigrants from Asia—almost all from China
and Japan—were among the most ghetto-bound
of the newcomers, rigidly segregated in their
"Chinatown" communities. And for generations,
neither the Asian Americans nor native-born
whites believed that they ever could or should
become integrated into American life. Most of the
Asian immigrants believed that Western civili-
zation was a form of barbarism, something to be
resisted in every possible way. Few American
officials paid any attention to whether Asian-
American children attended public schools. No
one thought it necessary for them to learn En-
glish. They were the victims of harassment, cruel
jokes, and vicious cartoons. The state of Califor-
nia had special taxes for "foreign miners." Mur-
derous riots against the Chinese took place in
every major Western city during the 1870s and
1880s. The Asians' subtle and sophisticated way
of cooking attracted some favorable attention, but
even their food came into the American diet and
language as "chop suey," an unkind culinary
joke.
In California, especially, the Chinese immi-
grants were the objects of a double discrimi-
nation. Almost every American of European
ancestry believed Asians were racially inferior.
But white workers also resented competition in
the labor market, especially during times of eco-
nomic depression and high unemployment. In
the 1870s the California Workingman's Party
began to agitate for a law forbidding any person
from China to hold a job. The effort succeeded.
In 1879 a clause was added to the state consti-
tution of California that forbade any employer to
hire Chinese workers. But no state had a consti-
tutional right to forbid immigration. That was
up to the national government. In 1882 an act
of Congress put a ten-year prohibition on Chi-
nese workers entering the United States as im-
migrants.
And so the new society that grew out of the
industrial revolution was an intensely segregated
society. As a result of the railroads and the rush
of pioneers to the West, Native Americans were
confined to their shrinking reservations. Blacks,
Asians, and European immigrants in the towns
and cities were just as confined to their ghettos.
The very meaning of the word American, as it was
normally used, reflected these racial and ethnic
segregations. Being an American meant, to most
people, not being "colored," not being Catholic or
Jewish, tiof having Slavic or Greek or Polish ways
and words. The two most intensely debated
questions of the day among "native" Ameri-
cans—that is, Protestant white people whose
ancestry was British or northwest European—
were: What could be done to slow down or stop
the "foreigners" from coming? Who among them
(if any) had a chance to become "Americans"?
BECOMING "AMERICAN" In the era of the
new immigration, the goal of many was still
assimilation—to take on the traits of the new soci-
ety so as to blend with it. But becoming an
"American" was not an easy process for most
European immigrants in the late nineteenth
century.
Real assimilation meant knowing the lan-
guage. Many immigrant parents made enormous
sacrifices to bring their families to a country
where education was free and easily available.
Mary Antin, a Jewish immigrant, remembered it
this way:
Education was free. It was the one thing that my
father was able to promise us when he sent for

THE CLIMAX OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION

Open-air restaurant. This pair of Chinese Americans have established their restaurant in a
lumber camp in the West. Chinese cuisine made its way into the European-American diet
only slowly in the nineteenth century. Guidebooks routinely described Chinese restaurants as
the haunts of the Chinese themselves, the European-American poor, "outlaws," and African
Americans. It never occurred to the authors of the guidebooks that poor people might not be
quite as bigoted as the American-born middle class (and that they might have more flexible
tastes, too). (Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley)

alley came and offered to conduct us to school.
We five children between us had a few words of
English by this time. We knew the word "school."
We understood. This child, who had never seen
us till yesterday, who was not much better
dressed than we were, still was able to offer us
the freedom of the schools of Boston! No appli-
cation made; no questions asked; no examina-
tions, rulings, exclusions; no fees.
Learning the language was only one step
toward assimilation. Many immigrants joined
some kind of voluntary association that brought
them contacts with native-born Americans. In cit-
ies, the most obvious associations were political
parties. They could provide favors, food, and
jobs.
"Boss" Richard Croker of Tammany Hall in
New York described the work of his machine as
dealing with people W'ho

laws, yet are the raw material with which we
have to build up the state. [The Tammany

agency is there by which so long a row could
have been hoed so quickly or so well?
Another powerful influence on the new immi-
grants was those who had preceded them. Some
of the earlier arrivals learned English and helped
recruit workers from Europe. They sometimes
even paid the newcomers' transportation and
helped them settle in the cities.
One popular name for such men was padrone
(an Italian word meaning "patron"). A padrone
might be paid by an employer for supplying
cheap labor, by a political machine for delivering
immigrant votes, or by the immigrants them-
selves for favors. Often the padrones, who
existed among almost every immigrant group,
were ward leaders in political machines, serving
as links between the newcomers and the city
organizations.
Urbanization
In the ancient world, only two great cities—Rome
and Alexandria—had populations of over half a
million people. By the time of Christopher
Columbus, Rome and Alexandria had long since
declined. The only European cities to have
reached a comparable size were London and
Paris. At the time of the Haymarket affair, how-
ever, Chicago had already become a great city. In
fact, by 1900 the United States had six cities with
more than half a million inhabitants.
The process of urbanization was not confined
to the United States. All the industrializing
nations of western Europe experienced it too. The
factory system demanded high concentrations of
workers, and the agricultural revolution made it
possible for millions of people to leave their
farms—whether in Germany or in Maine.
The United States experienced three great
migrations in the generation after the Civil War.
One was from the East to the Great Plains and
the Far West. Another was from Europe to Amer-
ica. The third was from the country to the city.
Of the three, the movement from farm to city
was the most extensive.
In 1800 only about 3 Americans out of every
100 lived in cities larger than 8,000. By 1900 this
proportion had grown 1,000 percent; almost a
third of the nation lived in cities of over 8,000.
In 1800 there had been only 6 cities larger than
8,000; by 1900 there were over 400.
This increase was not gradual and smooth.
Most of it came in the half-century' after the end
of the Civil War. During this period, at least 15
million native Americans moved out of farming
areas and into cities, and their number was swol-
len by an almost equal number of new immi-
grants who settled in cities instead of on farms.
Statistics tell the story. Between 1870 and 1900
the total population of the United States in-
creased by about 35 million people. During the
same period the urban population increased by
about 24 million. The cities had absorbed more
than two-thirds of the total increase.
TECHNOLOGICAL FACTORS A city is not
just a collection of people in a small area. Like
industry, modem dties were made possible by
technological change. In the centuries before the
industrial revolution, the size of a city had been
determined mainly by the available transporta-
tion. It could not be too big, because a person
had to be able to walk or travel by wagon or
carriage to a marketplace or job and back home
again. After about 1880, however, cities began to
experience a transportation revolution. The intro-
duction of electricity made it possible to replace
slow and awkward horse-drawn transport with
fast, clean trolleys, elevated trains, and subways.
These improvements meant that people could
live many miles from their place of work and still
be part of a vast city.
Electricity also made it possible to light city
streets. Cleveland, in 1879, became the first city
to have electric street lighting. Similarly, the
introduction of the telephone in the 1880s meant
that homes, offices, and factories could be tied
together in an almost instantaneous communi-
cations network.

A NEW WEST
fc
"forty-niners" and were celebrated in popular
songs and stories, but the mythic version of this
first American gold rush is a far cry from the
reality. In most of the mining camps, somewhere
between a fourth and half of the men were
foreign-born. Experienced and skillful miners
from Mexico came by the thousands, working in
hills and valleys that had belonged to their nation
just a few years before. Other skilled, Spanish-
speaking miners came up the Pacific coast from
Peru. News of the gold strike rippled around the
Pacific Rim, and within three years there were
25,000 Chinese in California. (The new state gov-
ernment of California was quick to respond to
these foreign "threats." In the first year of state-
hood, 1850, the California legislature passed a
law requiring "foreign miners" to apply for spe-
cial licenses and to pay a fee of twenty dollars a
month for the privilege of looking for gold.)
Some of the forty-niners did strike it rich,
although the people who made the most money
were probably not the miners and prospectors
but those who set up businesses to sell them
food, clothing, tools, or whiskey. Most of the men
who rushed to California were disappointed.
Many of them began to drift east, through the
Sierra Nevada, looking for new bonanzas. In
1858, prospectors found gold near Pike's Peak in

through the West to California. The North and
the South, however, had not been able to agree
on the western part of the route. The North
wanted a line to run from Chicago to San Fran-
cisco. The South insisted on a route through
Texas to southern California.
The Civil War ended this competition. By
seceding, the South lost its right to participate in
the decision making. In 1862 Congress settled on
a route between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and San
Francisco. The same law provided for enormous
financial support from the federal government.
There would be two companies. The Central
Pacific would build east from San Francisco. The
Union Pacific (a patriotic name suited to wartime)
would go west across Nebraska and Colorado.
They were to meet somewhere in tne middle.
Each railroad would be given a right-of-way 400
feet wide. In addition, the government would
lend the railroads up'to $48,000 for each mile of
track laid—less for flat country, more for moun-
tain track. Most important, the railroads would
be given 6,400 acres for every mile of track com-
pleted. In 1864 this land allowance was doubled.
The Central Pacific started building toward the
east, but the work went slowly for two reasons.
First, the company did not have enough capital.
Second, labor was scarce in California. The first
problem was eased when the Lincoln adminis-
tration allowed the Central Pacific to claim flat-
country' miles as mountain miles, which entitled
the company to the largest possible federal loans.
The labor problem was "solved" by the brutal
importation of thousands of Chinese laborers.
Many of them were unwilling immigrants, and
all of them were exploited as gang labor. They
lived in extremely crude conditions, with poor
food and almost no housing. And when the
tracks were laid and their work was finished, they
would be cast loose to try to earn their livings in
the cities and towns of California, in a society
whose European-American majority was at least
as bigoted toward them as toward Native Amer-
icans or African Americans. But the Chinese
workers endured, and their endurance was trans-
lated into rail mileage. In the first year of con-
struction, 1864, the Central Pacific had completed
only twenty miles of track. But by 1867 the pace
was up to twenty miles per month, largely as a
result of Chinese-American labor.
At the other end of the proposed route the
Union Pacific also built slowly, at first. But it
picked up speed by bringing in thousands of Irish
immigrants to lay rails. In 1868 alone the Union
Pacific laid 425 miles of track, well over a mile a
day.
In May 1869, after only five years of construc-
tion, the two work gangs met at Promontory
Point, Utah, just east of the Great Salt Lake. The
last crosstie put down was coated with silver; the
last spike was gold. A telegraph operator cabled
east and west: "Hats off—prayer is being
offered." Then there was a wait of almost fifteen
minutes. Again the telegraph clicked. "We have
got done praying. The spike is about to be pre-
sented." Railroad officials took turns with the
hammer; the first blow was a bad miss, but the
work was done. Two locomotives eased forward
until they touched. The nation celebrated almost
as wildly as it had at the end of the Civil War.
Chicago's parade was seven miles long. The
nation was joined, east to west, across a "desert"
that an earlier generation had believed would
never be settled.
During the next fifteen years three more routes
were opened across the Rockies. Iowa, Missouri,
Kansas, and Nebraska were crisscrossed by rails.
In the process, the government gave the railroad
companies almost 180 million acres of public
land, and it lent them over $100 million. Because
of complicated regulations that allowed railroads
to delay choosing the land they wanted to keep
along their rights-of-way, they were able to keep
great stretches of land for years, waiting for its
price to rise.
At one point the railroads controlled—at least
on paper—almost all of Iowa and Wisconsin. The
Northern Pacific, whose route crossed the north-
ern tier of states between Lake Superior and the
Pacific, controlled a strip of land larger in area
than many European nations. The same kind of
situation developed in Arizona and New Mexico.
By 1885 the railroads held land totaling almost a
sixth of the entire country.
678
A NEW WEST
East meets West. In the years after the Civil War, American railroad companies imported
thousands of Chinese workers to help finish the rail network in the mountains and deserts of
the West. Here, Chinese workers use hand labor to complete a graceful and impressive trestle
on the Central Pacific Railroad in the Sierra Nevada of California. (Library of Congress)
Many of the congressmen and senators who
voted these huge grants to the railroads did so
in the belief that most of the land in the "Great
American Desert" was of little value. The motive
behind the first transcontinental lines was not to
build a transportation network for the Great
Plains and the Rockies but to build a link to the
Pacific Coast. It took a generation's experience to
make clear that the intervening territory was val-
uable, that it would be settled and farmed. As
things turned out, the railroads may have been
a very efficient mechanism for disposing of the
public lands, at least in some areas. The govern-
ment's own land policy was confused and often
corrupt, and the "public interest" may, on bal-
ance, have been served about as well by the rail-
road grants as by the government's direct land
grant practices. But the public whose interest was
at stake was, of course, solely a white public.
From Buffalo to Cattle
In any case, the first important effects of the rail-
roads on the Great Plains had less to do with land
ownership and cultivation than with animals.
The railroads created a new industry on the
plains: ranching. Building the railroads not only
hastened the destruction of the buffalo herds, it
made possible the systematic exploitation of
another set of resources: grass and cows.

not been for "my damned old black face." An
even larger number of cowboys, probably a third
or more, were of Mexican ancestry. In fact, the
Mexican counterparts of the American cowboys,
the vaqueros (from the Spanish word vaca, cow),
had mastered their trade long before Anglo-
Americans reached Texas or the plains. If an
American cowboy called his pony a pinto, it was
because that Spanish word meant "painted." If
he roped with a lariat, it was because the Spanish
term for such a rope was la reata. If he preferred
to say lasso, he was using the Spanish word for
a snare, lazo. If he called another man hotnbre, If
he said wimoose instead of leave, or savvy instead
of kntnv, it was because the Spanish hotnbre,
ihviios, and saber meant "man," "we're going,"
and "to know," respectively.
THE END OF THE OPEN RANGE The long
drive had a brief existence. Gradually, people
north of Texas realized that as the railroads came
closer, it made sense to breed and feed cattle
nearby instead of driving them up from Texas.
SOCIETY AND CULTURE IN THE 1920s
861
Sigmund Freud on sex began to be discussed at
the dinner table and in the polite magazines of
the middle class. Words like bitch appeared in
novels published by respectable publishers and
read by respectable people. Petting and necking
became part of the everyday vocabulary of mag-
azine readers and even ministers. In the movies,
sex became a major box-office attraction. Stars like
Theda Bara and Clara Bow appeared on the
screen in wispy clothing, locked in long, pas-
sionate embraces with their leading men. When
Oara Bow was advertised as the "It" girl, hardly
anyone needed to ask what "It" meant.
Americans drank more, too. Despite Prohi-
bition (see Chapter 20), liquor was easy to obtain.
And since liquor was illegal, millions of Ameri-
cans became technically criminals on an almost
daily basis. Probably half the respectable, middle-
class families in the nation had their regular boot-
legger. Terms like "bathtub gin" and "speakeasy"
became part of the national language. Especially
in colleges, drinking became a regular pastime of
the "flaming youth" of the decade.
A BLACK RENAISSANCE The Jazz Age was a
distinctly urban phenomenon. It was also an out-
come of the greatest large-scale influence black
music, dance, and style had ever had on white,
middle-class Americans. And these two facts
reflected two important changes in the African-
American’experience. The first of these changes
was one of the most massive and significant
migrations in American history- In 1910, nine out
of ten African Americans still lived in the South,
almost all of them in rural areas where they
worked for meager wages as sharecroppers or
day laborers. But blacks were beginning to leave
the farms for the cities in great numbers. In the
1920s, 1.5 million African Americans moved into
urban areas, most of them in the North.
The second great change in black experience
was vocational. Those blacks who had managed
to get an education during the decades after the
end of Reconstruction had almost all been con-
fined to careers as ministers or teachers in small
towns, or managed to get work as clerks in a
special environment like Washington, D.C. In
1910 there was exactly one black judge and two
state legislators in the entire United States. But
things were changing. Black colleges were turn-
ing out hundreds of graduates every' year, and
a few blacks were able to graduate from old-
line w'hite colleges and universities. (The first
black football players to be singled out as "All-
Americans," in 1916 and 1917, played for elite,
private white colleges. Brown and Rutgers, and
each was the first black ever to play varsity
sports.) The migration to Northern cities made it
possnle for ambitious young blacks to pursue
careers—as lawyers, actors, singers, writers, edi-
tors—that would have been impossible in the
rural South.
The place where these two changes came
together to produce remarkable results was the
part of Manhattan known by the old Dutch name
of Harlem. The district, which ran north from
125th Street, had already become a black neigh-
borhood by 1920. It was a neighborhood with real
style, the place where every young black with
ambition to be a doctor or a poet, a plavw'right
or a lawyer took his or her dream,
W. E. B. Du Bois had brought his magazine.
The Crisis, to Harlem at the beginning of World
War 1. After the war the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)
moved its headquarters to Harlem (and at the
same time replaced a predominantly'white board
of officers with a group of blacks headed by poet
and lawyer James Weldon Johnson). Du Bois and
Johnson were typical of the kinds of people who
were going to lead black movements in the 1920s
in one important respect: They were not just
political men interested in social justice. They
were also intellectuals, writers, and poets with an
intense interest in art and culture. Soon they were
joined in Harlem by a remarkable generation of
black intellectuals and artists, many of them
immigrants from the West Indies. Together they
produced what they themselves referred to with
justifiable pride as the Negro Renaissance or the
Harlem Renaissance.
CRASH. DEPRESSION. AND A NEW DEAL'

Sacco and Vanzelti. Here, in 1927,
Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Van-
zetti enter the courtroom to make
their last plea for justice. Some
recent evidence seems to show that
at least one of them may have been

with. But no amount of new evi-
dence can set aside the fact that
they were unfairly tried and un-
fairly convicted. (UPl/Bettmann

martyrs, modern counterparts of the victims of
the Salem witch trials and the Haymarket affair.
But to most Americans, they were just Italian
radicals who had been properly punished.
The bonus marchers of 1932 had to contend
with the lingering effects of the red scare. They
were accused of being communists and serving
as tools in a foreign conspiracy. When Douglas
MacArthur marched on their camp at Anacostia,
he did so in the belief that he was protecting the
country from a powerful revolutionary move-
ment. The irony was, however, that the marchers
themselves accepted much of the ideology of
"Americanism" that underlay the red scare. Their
response to the charge that they were commu-
nists was to insist on their own patriotism, and
to point proudly to their record of military ser-
vice. Most of the marchers were probably just as
devoutly anticommunist, just as insistent on their
own "100 percent Americanism" as their critics.
The red scare also made it possible for those
Americans who feared immigrants and their eth-
nic and religious differences to restrict immigra-
tion. In February 1921 (over the veto of President
Wilson), Congress passed a law that limited
immigration, especially from countries in south-
ern and eastern Europe. According to the law,
the number of immigrants from a country in any
given year could not exceed 3 percent of the num-
ber of people of that nationality who were already
in the United States in 1910. In 1924 the law was
made even more restrictive. Quotas would now
be based on resident population in 1890, immi-
gration limited to 150,000 per year after 1927,
and Asians totally excluded. The effect of the
law's was to end, almost at once, the flow of
immigration.
PROHIBITION AND REACTION Like the red
scare and the movement for immigration restric-
tion, the prohibition of alcohol in the 1920s had
its roots in the progressive period. In 1919 the
states had passed the Eighteenth Amendment,
which empowered Congress to prohibit the sale
of alcoholic beverages. The amendment marked
the victory of a long campaign of "temperance."
It provided another rallying point for conserva-
tive, small-town Americans. They divided society
into the "drys" and the "wets" and opposed any
politician who did not favor Prohibition.
The Prohibition movement failed to stop
Americans from drinking. In most cities, people
continued to drink whiskey in speakeasies. The

new efforts to use the Constitution and the courts
to protect the basic rights of black citizens—a
struggle that Would reach a climax after World
War II, in the 1950s and 1960s.
For those who would not wait, there was one
final consolation to be wrung from the New Deal.
It came in 1941, when it was becoming increas-
ingly clear that depression and the New Deal
were about to give way to war. A. Philip
Randolph, the brilliant and militant leader of the
black union movement, decided that the time had
come for blacks to demand justice from their gov-
ernment. He proposed a grand, all-black march
on Washington. The Roosevelt administration
was anxious to prevent "disorder" in the capital.
And some officials were afraid that "communists"
would "infiltrate" the movement. Roosevelt
decided to negotiate. He told black leaders that
if they would call off the march, he would estab-
lish a Fair Employment Practices Commission,
with at least some power to try to enforce equal
treatment for black and white workers in the few
industries where working conditions could be
federally regulated. Randolph and his colleagues
accepted the deal, and the commission was estab-
lished in the summer of 1941, just a few months
before the United States entered World War II.
As one black newspaper put it, most African
Americans thought they had little choice but to
support Roosevelt and the Democrats, "until the
real thing comes along."
MEXICAN AMERICANS A large influx of
Mexican laborers into California and the South-
west, where most of them became migrant farm
workers, had taken place in the 1920s. But the

Mexicanos on strike. The striking

irresistible forces of the depression turned on
them severely. Hundreds of thousands of white
farm families of the Southwest's Dust Bowl were
losing their land or their sharecropping arrange-
ments and heading west to California. The result
was a dramatic reversal of the tides of migration.
At the beginning of the crisis, only a small mi-
nority of the migrant work force on California
farms had been North Americans. By the end of
the decade, the North Americans—the "Okies"
and the "Arkies"—made up nine-tenths of that
labor force, doing the toilsome and low-paying
jobs that had once been left to Mexicano
"braceros."
The result was a huge outmigration of Mexi-
cans and Mexican Americans. In the first five
years of the depression, about half a million left.
The U.S. census—woefully inaccurate when it
came to minority groups—counted only half as
many Mexican-born people in 1940 as it had in
1930. This drop was just about equal to the num-
ber of landless North Americans who had wan-
dered into California looking for work. But the
Mexicanos were not only discouraged by the eco-
nomic crisis, they also were encouraged to go by
governments like California's, which offered one-
way tickets to Mexico, free of charge, to anyone
willing to leave. And to offers like this, local
police and bureaucrats often added harassment
and ugly treatment. A government official in Cali-
fornia said that "Mexicans are trash. ... We herd
them like pigs." (His command of English was
weak. He was obviously trying to say that he
thought Mexicans were like pigs. But his sen-
tence could also mean "We herd them as though
vx were pigs.")
Some of the Mexicanos did resist, did refuse
the free tickets "home," and did try to do some-
thing about their difficult jobs and miserable
earnings. In the 1930s, Mexicano workers began
to organize, to resist exploitation at the hands of
Norteamericano landowners—and exploitation,
too, at the hands of fellow Mexicanos who orga-
nized work gangs and wrote contracts with the

farmers. They organized a union, the Confede-
ration de Uniones de Campesinos y Obreros
Mexicanos (Confederation of Unions of Mexican
Campesinos and Workers). There is no easy
translation of cantpesino. It is sometimes trans-
lated as "peasants." But its meaning in Mexico
and Central America covered a variety of forms
of agricultural experience that included most of
the rural poor, even those who owned small
farms. The Confederacion supported a number
of bitter and sometimes bloody strikes during
harvest seasons in the 1930s. In the largest strike,
which took place in 1933, 18,000 Mexicano pick-
ers refused to harvest the cotton crop in the rich
San Joaquin Valley of California. But two strikers
were murdered, and the violence eventually
broke the strike. Still, during the next seven
years, the Confederacion promoted twenty-five
major strikes.
By the end of the decade most landowners had
shown that they preferred to hire North Ameri-
can workers, if they would work for the same
low wages. The North Americans proved to be
more docile than those Mexicanos who had
stayed in the United States. As for the federal
government, it tried to assist migrant farm work-
ers by setting up camps run by the Farm Security'
Administration, camps that could provide decent
temporary housing for laboring people. But the
camps were established only in 1937, and the
men who ran them, like the landowners, showed
a definite preference for assisting North Ameri-
can migrant families. (John Steinbeck's famous
novel about the sufferings of migrant workers in
California, The Crapes of Wrath, was a moving and
sympathetic book. But it did not have a single
Mexican or Mexican-American character. His
depiction of a Farm Security Administration
camp is of an institution with no Mexicanos—or
blacks, either.) Since agricultural workers were
not covered by major New Deal programs like
Social Security or the Wagner Act, and since only
proven citizens were eligible for federal relief, the
Mexicanos got little or no benefit from the New
Deal.
NATIVE AMERICANS For Native Americans,
economic depression was nothing new. For half
a century Native Americans on reservations had
lived in increasingly miserable conditions. Their
main resource was land. But land ownership was
governed by the rules of the Dawes Severalty Act
of 1887 (see pp. 687-88). Under the terms of this
law, land that tribes had once owned in common
became the property of individual families. But
with each passing generation, a fixed amount of
land had to be divided among several children.
The only alternative was for new' generations to
leave the reservations altogether, and try to cope
with hardship and discrimination in towns and
cities. So the inevitable long-term effect of the
Dawes Act was to promote poverty and want.
The situation was perhaps worst in Okla-
homa, which had once been the "Indian Terri-
tory." During the nineteenth century the federal
government had crowded about thirty different
tribes onto a skimpy expanse of land that was
not very fertile in the first place. Increasing
populations were unable to feed themselves ade-
quately. Disease, especially tuberculosis, was epi-
demic. To Native Americans, the news that there
was something called a "panic" on a street named
"Wall" would have had a significance that was
mainly ironic or bitter. And it appeared that help
was not going to come to them any sooner than
it w'as coming to the Mexican Americans. In 1929
the Hoover administration ruled that Native
Americans living on reservations were not eli-
gible for even the meager relief funds being pro-
vided by the federal government.
Then, in 1933, Roosevelt appointed a new
commissioner of Indian affairs, John Collier, a
former social worker. Collier made a number of
decisions that were of real benefit to Native
Americans who lived on reservations. Some of
the decisions were of genuine symbolic impor-
tance. He ordered the bureaucrats who admin-
istered federal programs to respect Native
American customs, language, and dress. He told
them to stop doing what they had been doing for
half a century, trying to force Indians to dress

A GLOBAL NATION
Army had reached 1.4 million men by July 1941.
But after total mobilization, this number moved
up rapidly. By 1945 over 8 million men were in
the Army. {The Women’s Army Corps—WAC—
reached about 100,000 at this time.) The Navy
experienced a similar expansion, reaching 3.4
million, with the Marines constituting about
500,000 of this total. The Air Force (administra-
tively part of the Army) also expanded rapidly.
Military service touched all populations in
America. By the end of the war about 1 million
black Americans had participated in the various
services, for example. The American armed
forces in World War II mixed ethnic groups and
social class, but in a curious way. Universal con-
scription threw together Northerners and South-
erners, autoworkers and college professors. But
if this necessitated a kind of melting pot culture
in the barracks, it did not mean that democracy'
or racial harmony prevailed. For example, black
soldiers were segregated into units commanded
by white officers. Often they were relegated to
stevedore or construction work. Japanese Ameri-
cans were placed in special ethnic units such as
the Nisei 442 Infantry Regiment that fought in
Italy. Thus, despite the commitment to defeat
Nazism—the most virulent racism of the twen-
tieth century—few Americans saw anything para-
doxical in establishing and maintaining racial seg-
regation throughout the military. This is even
more curious because American war films often
pictured foxholes as representative democracies,
and such films as Bataan (1943) even implied that
racial integration existed where it clearly did not.
Once the United States had entered the war,
Roosevelt decided on a strategy of attrition to
defeat the Axis powers. He planned an enormous
economic effort in which superior resources, sup-
plies, productivity, organization, and scientific
breakthroughs would overwhelm the enemy.
This emphasis on weapons, he believed, would
minimize American casualties. With this aim in
mind, he authorized the secret building of the
atomic bomb. His commitment made the factory
assembly lines as important as the front lines of
fighting men.
THE WARTIME ECONOMY The war buildup
also meant new federal economic controls. After
Pearl Harbor, Congress granted sweeping pow-
ers to the executive branch. On January' 16,1942,
Roosevelt created the War Production Board,
which had the power to channel civilian produc-
tion into armaments manufacture and to contract
for the construction of new defense plants. With
the massive reorientation of production, the draft
of millions of men, and a rise in employment,
the United States suddenly faced labor shortages.
War orders wiped aw'ay the huge unemployment
left from the depression. The War Manpower
Commission was organized to recruit new work-
ers for the booming defense sector.
Tire largest pool of potential employees was
women, and millions of them eagerly took over
jobs in aircraft, shipbuilding, and munitions
plants. They w'ent to vocational schools and
learned trades and skills that transformed their
lives. They were crucial in building the vast array
of weapons that poured from the factories. They
constructed B-29 bombers like the Enola Gay that
carried the first atomic bomb; they built the tanks
and ships that shattered the Nazi armies and the
Japanese navy.
While the employment of women in factories
was expected to be temporary, it had profound
and lasting effects. Several million women
attended vocational schools. As early as 1942,
over 35 percent of the American work force w'as
female. Bv the end of the wrar, surveys revealed,
a majority of these working women hoped to
keep their positions. But telltale signs during the
war suggested that "Rosie the Riveter” would
eventually be pushed aside. Differential wages
for men and women, hostility in the workplace,
antagonism from unions, and, most of all, failure
of the Roosevelt administration to support the
Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution
(part of the 1944 Democratic national platform)
suggested that gains made could be undone.
The other large group of potential workers
were African Americans. At first, they were
generally excluded from defense employment
opportunities. But A. Philip Randolph of the

This simple, wooden sign, posted in the desert, marked the entrance to the Manzanar reloca-
tion center for Japanese families uprooted from their homes, primarily in the Los Angeles
area. Other camps housed still more Japanese Americans, rounded up and deported from the
coastal areas of the western United States. (Library of Congress)
Labor disputes did not disappear, but in general,
the War Labor Board did much to ease the pres-
sure on wages, and it allowed unions to raise
their membership extensively.
Another new agency, the Office of Price
Administration, tried to limit price rises by set-
ting maximum prices for standard items, it also
oversaw the rationing of scarce items such as cof-
fee, canned foods (to save tin), shoes, and gaso-
line (to save rubber tires). Although many work-
ers earned more money than before the war,
there were few goods to spend it on; even a thriv-
ing black market could not supply them.
Extensive government control over the econ-
omy was matched by increased federal attention
to shaping public opinion and preventing pos-
sible subversion. In this climate, civil liberties suf-
fered. Of course the military' censored news from
the front. There was little serious opposition to
the war, but even so, the administration over-
reacted as demands for security and secrecy
increased. For example, it brought a group of
inconsequential American fascists and right-wing
opponents of the war to trial.
JAPANESE-AMERICAN INTERNMENT
Much more serious was the treatment of Japanese
Americans. In early 1942, American command-
ers on the West Coast argued that Japanese resi-
dents must be removed. This fear of sabotage
scarcely concealed a long-standing racial antip-
athy toward the Japanese in California. (There
was no corresponding internment of Japanese

residents of Hawaii, where race relations were
better.)
Thus, on February 19, 1942, President Roo-
sevelt issued Executive Order #9066, which per-
mitted removal of alien Japanese, Germans,
Italians, and all persons of Japanese ancestry,
whether citizens or not, from any "military area."
These sensitive areas included California and
parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona. In
practice, exceptions were made for other groups
so that only the Japanese were actually removed.
This policy may have had military considera-
tions as its justification, but it also continued a
history of exclusion and racial segregation. In
1924 Congress had denied further immigration
to the Japanese, abrogating a "gentlemen's agree-
ment" of 1907-08 between the United States and
Japan in which Japan promised to restrict immi-
gration. Despite the burden of this history and
various local laws that discriminated, the
Japanese community had achieved considerable
success in agriculture and small businesses. Their
largest communities were centered largely
around Los Angeles and Seattle, with much
smaller contingents in San Francisco.
By June 1942 over 100,000 had been forcibly
removed, their property and jobs stripped away.
Most were placed in ten crude, dusty Army
camps and provided with tarpaper barracks, cots,
common toilets, and shared bathing and laundry
facilities.
One internee recalled a camp set on a bleak
plain behind Los Angeles:
There was a lack of privacy when we first went
to Manzanar. The barracks were not actually
completed. There were terrible wind storms that
swept through the Owens Valley which brought
dust through the cracks in the door. 1 think there
were two months running where we suffered
from diarrhea. The food wras not properly
prepared.

Many of the internees gained their release
before the end of the war, but few ever recovered
their farms, businesses, or homes. In 1988 Con-
gress passed a law apologizing to Japanese Ameri-
cans and promised $20,000 in compensation for
each internee.
The War in Europe
While the administration worked to organize pro-
duction, it defined its strategy to win the war. In
practical terms, the United States had disagree-
ments with Kith of its major allies. Roosevelt
opposed Britain's desire to hold on to its vast
colonial empire. And he was reluctant to allow
the Russians to establish control over the inva-
sion routes across eastern European nations. The
president tried to circumvent potential friction
through face-to-face encounters with Churchill
and Stalin. Several conferences shaped the course
of the war and established general principles for
a peace settlement. In 1941, even before the
United States entered the war, Churchill and
Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter, a
document that outlined international rights and
responsibilities and promised self-determination,
free trade, and the abandonment of force after
the war. They also agreed to focus on defeating
Germany first. Even after Pearl Harbor, this
meant that a substantial portion of war supplies
went to Britain and the Soviet Union; the Asian
war took second place.
Churchill and Roosevelt made a second major
decision at Casablanca, Morocco, in January 1943.
There the two leaders agreed to demand uncon-
ditional surrender of the Axis powers in order to
fix blame for the war on Hitler and Mussolini; no
negotiated or partial peace with the fascist leaders
would be tolerated.
For the Russians, the immediate and para-
mount problem was the opening of a second
front—by an Allied invasion of France—so as to
divert the German armies and relieve the enor-
mous pressure that Hitler had brought to bear on
the Soviet Union. The Russians were reeling
before the German onslaught, sustaining huge
casualties and losses of territory. A longer-range
Russian desire was to gain control of those areas
through which the Germans had twice invaded
during the twentieth century.
Roosevelt and the U.S. Army commander,
Dwight Eisenhower, agreed with the proposal for
a second front, but Churchill twice convinced
Roosevelt to postpone a landing, arguing that
preparations remained incomplete, in August
1942 Churchill explained to Stalin why the United
States and Britain had chosen to invade North
Africa instead of France. Preparations for the
attack advanced, and in November 1942, Allied
forces landed in French North Africa. At first,
French troops loyal to the Vichy government
resisted, but Eisenhower negotiated a capitula-
tion w'ith Admiral Jean Francois Darla n. Ameri-
can and British troops pushed into Tunisia to
engage German forces led by General Erwin
Rommel ("the Desert Fox"). By May 1943 the bat-
tle for North Africa had ended. Rommel was
defeated and a large contingent of his army cap-
tured. But Russia still stood alone with no second
front in sight.
Once again, in the spring of 1943, the western
Allies postponed the invasion of France. This
time the United States and Britain decided to
attack Sicily and knock Italy out of the war. Once
again, the Russians were angered and suspicious
that Britain and the United States wanted them
to continue to bear the brunt of the European
struggle. Nonetheless, the Allied command went
ahead; troops landed in Sicily on July 9, 1943,
and took thirty-eight days to conquer the island,
although the bulk of the German army escaped
into Italy.
This victory led to the fall of the Italian fascist
leader, Mussolini. A provisional government
signed a peace treaty with the Allies on Septem-
ber 3, and Italy switched sides in the war. On
the same day, British and American troops
invaded Italy itself, and gradually they pushed a

land, and Indiana. But Goldwater could not build
a movement strong enough to block the Johnson
landslide.
THE WAR IN VIETNAM One relatively unim-
portant campaign issue was the war in Vietnam.
During his year in office, Johnson had proceeded
cautiously, without calling attention to the impli-
cations of his actions, but he moved the United
States toward far greater involvement in the war.
Early in 1964 he made several important deci-
sions. He approved plans for covert harassment
of North Vietnam, and he agreed to bombing
missions against the north in the event of prov-
ocation. He also appointed General William
Westmoreland to head military operations. These
moves rested on two assumptions: first, that
North Vietnam was responsible for and could
control the insurgent Viet Cong in the south; sec-
ond, that American intervention in the form of
air strikes and ground troops could be decisive.
Johnson and his advisers did not believe that
American actions would increase the fighting in
the south or cause an uncontrollable infiltration
of troops and arms from the north.
The pretext for full-scale intervention came
in late July 1964. On July 30 South Vietnamese
PT (patrol torpedo) boats attacked bases in the
Gulf of Tonkin inside North Vietnamese waters.
Simultaneously, the Maddox, an American de-
stroyer, steamed into the area to disrupt North
Vietnamese communication facilities. On August
2, possibly seeing the two separate missions as
a combined maneuver against them, North Viet-
nam sent out several PT boats to attack the
destroyer. The Maddox fired, sinking one of the
attackers, then radioed the news to Washington.
Johnson ordered another ship into the bay. On
August 3 both destroyers reported another
attack—although somewhat later, the com-
mander of the Maddox radioed that he was not
sure. Nonetheless, the president ordered Amer-
ican planes to retaliate by bombing inside North
Vietnam.
Johnson then sought congressional support
and justification for his action. He quickly re-
ceived it. Senator William Fulbright guided a res-
olution through his Foreign Relations Committee
and then through the Senate in less than a week.
Fulbright's action was perhaps related to his fear
that Barry Goldwater might use the Vietnam
issue in the forthcoming election. Neither he nor
anyone else in the Senate had been told all the
facts about the Gulf of Tonkin skirmish, and later
critics would question whether or not an attack
had actually occurred.

Like the Korean War and the cold war, the
origins of the war in Vietnam lay partly in unre-
solved questions left over from World War II.
American participation in the struggle was bv
accumulation, some of it public and some of it
secret. This made it a process and a cause that
few Americans understood very well.
The fighting in Vietnam began in 1945, at the
end of Japanese occupation, and terminated in
1975, when North Vietnamese and Viet Cong sol-
diers marched into Saigon, the South Vietnamese
capital, thus putting an end to the last American-
supported government. This thirty-year struggle
by communist-led forces sought to eliminate first
French and then American influence in Vietnam.
Essentially a civil war, it was complicated by
French colonialism, by international agreements,
by encouragement and aid from outside nations,
and by a massive effort of the United States to
thwart the communists.
When the French reconquered most of their
former colony of Vietnam after World War II,
communist forces inspired by Ho Chi Minh
began an uprising that eventually defeated the
French in 1954 at the battle of Dien Bien Phu.
From 1950, the United States supplied the French
but refused direct intervention. During the Eisen-
hower administration, the president and his
advisers sympathized with the French, gave
them aid, and hoped to prevent the further
spread of communist influence in Asia. But
Eisenhower also understood the extreme risks of
direct involvement in another Asian war after the
unpopular conflict in Korea.
Exhausted and defeated after Dien Bien Phu,
the French agreed to a peace conference in
Geneva, Switzerland, in July 1954. The Geneva
Accords provided for French withdrawal and
temporarily divided Vietnam into two adminis-
trative areas: the north, occupied by the com-
munist Viet Minh, and the south, organized by
pro-French Vietnamese. Reunification elections
were mandated to decide the permanent fate of
the nation. The United States sent observers to
the Geneva conference but did not sign the
accords. In fact, the Central Intelligence Agency
worked secretly to undermine the agreements,
to disrupt the economy of the north, and to install
a pro-American ruler in the south. This last goal
was accomplished when Ngo Dinh Diem became
prime minister of the south. Diem asked for and
received advice and aid from the United States.
And he refused to participate in reunification.
Partly to counter this, Diem's opponents, aided
by the north, turned to insurgency.
From this time onward, American financial
and military support poured in as five American
presidents, from Eisenhower to Ford, attempted
to salvage American interests in the area. For the
United States, however, intervention had no
really distinct beginning. War was never officially
declared, although the Gulf of Tonkin resolution

authorized the president to protect American
forces and interests in the area. American partic-
ipation grew in small increments, sometimes
openly and sometimes secretly. By 1965 there
were 181,000 American troops in South Vietnam;
by 1968 there were 536,000.
Like the Korean War, the war in Vietnam was
fought within serious constraints. The ultimate
suppliers of war materiel—the United States, the
U.S.S.R., and China—were not attacked, and
supply lines into Vietnam remained open on both
sides for most of the war. The victory the United
States sought was the permanent establishment
of a Western-oriented government in South Viet-
nam. But the means to achieve this were, from
the beginning, controversial.
The nature of warfare in Vietnam was deter-
mined by the jungle terrain and by the sympathy
of many South Vietnamese for the rebels. In the
absence of fronts or battle lines, the Viet Cong
(South Vietnamese rebels) and North Vietnamese
troops could choose the time and place of engage-
ment. After a battle, they could slip into dense
jungles or hide among supporters in the peas-
antry. Their weapons were sometimes crude—
they used booby traps and captured arms—but
they also possessed more sophisticated Russian
and Chinese equipment. The United States,
adapting to jungle warfare, relied most heavily
on helicopters, which gave great flexibility to
troop movements. After 1964, American tactics
focused on preventing supplies from reaching
rebels in the south. Intensive bombing and defol-
iation of jungle foliage with herbicides disrupted
supply routes, but eventually intensive bombing
of North Vietnam was undertaken to cut supplies
off at the source.
In his first year in office, Johnson prided him-
self on the consensus he had achieved in domes-
tic and foreign affairs. In dealing with Vietnam
he appeared to be a moderate. And in some
respects he was. But he locked himself in by three
assumptions that gradually convinced him to
commit more men and more resources to the
Indochina war. The first of these beliefs was the
"domino theory," originally propounded by
Eisenhower. This notion assumed that if South
Vietnam fell to the communist-supported insur-
gents, other Southeast Asian nations would top-
ple into the communist camp. The second as-
sumption was that gradual escalation, covert
action, and misinformation could hide the war
from the American people and thus preserve con-
sensus. (The war would be over before anyone
realized its extent or cost.) Finally, Johnson
wanted to save face. He believed that the United
States could not afford to withdraw or back down
without inviting a barrage of accusations that he
had sold out to the communists. Having lived
through one period of McCarthvism, he was
determined to prevent another.
THE LIMITS OF POLITICS
1057
A Vietnamese casualty. Both sides in the Vietnam War inllicted heavy casualties on innocent
civilians. Photographs such as this one, featured in American newspapers and on nightly tele-
vision newscasts, convinced many Americans that the fight could never be won without a
savagery and brutality that they would not support. ( Philip Jones Griffiths/Magnum)
Believing the optimistic appraisals of his mil-
itary advisers and the "hawks" in his adminis-
tration, he gradually committed American troops
and prestige'to the jungle war. He cut himself off
from the "doves" (war opponents) in Congress.
Planning strategy and defending his decisions
against mounting public criticism became his
preoccupations. By pursuing this policy, he con-
vinced many Americans that the Democratic
party had fallen to the control of a narrow group
of professional politicians who could not under-
stand w hy any reasonable person might oppose
the war.
The Vietnam War w’as only one factor that
undercut support for the liberal consensus on
which Johnson depended. There were growing
numbers of critics of the federal activism of the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Oppo-
nents of integration and conservatives in general
rejected the notion that government should in-
tervene in the economic and social order to
guarantee a fair distribution of opportunity and
rewards. From the opposite point of view, stu-
dents, the civil rights movement, the poor, and
then the growing women's movement criticized
the federal government for delaying social
reforms.
The New Right

the "new right." Born in the troubled 1950s from
the marriage of traditional conservatism and a
new, vociferous right wing, this movement cap-
tured the Republican party temporarily in |9f>4
