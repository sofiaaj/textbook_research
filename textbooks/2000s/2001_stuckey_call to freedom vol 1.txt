Urban ProblemsAmerican cities in the early and mid-1800s facedmany challenges as a result of their rapid develop-ment. Many urban residents-particularly immi-grants-could only afford to live in dirty,overcrowded, and poorly built housing structurescalled tenements.Diseases spread easily in the unsanitary condi-tions of the tenements. Epidemics were commonbecause cities lacked clean water, public healthregulations, or sanitary ways to dispose of garbageand human waste. These problems posed perhapsthe greatest risks for poor immigrants. The choleraepidemics of 1832 and 1849 in New York City, forexample, hit Irish immigrants particularly hard.Other factors besides disease made urban lifedangerous. As populations rose, urban commu-nities became centers of criminal activity. Mostcities-including New York, Boston, andPhiladelphia-had no permanent police force tofight crime. Instead, they relied on volunteer nightwatches that provided inadequate protection.During the 1800s poor city residents often lived inFire protection was also usually poor.
