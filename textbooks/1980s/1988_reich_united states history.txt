People were arriving from all over Europe. They had different customs, languages, ideas, and ways of doing things. From Africa came other set- tlers—brought here against their will. These black slaves contributed to the growing life of the colonies, too. Changes took place as the colonies absorbed these different people and what they brought with them. The colonies became less and less like the England that had been left behind. The land and weather were very different in places, of course. But the biggest differences had to do with the unique blend of people. Their customs and ideas were growing and changing the colonies. For many people, the colonies offered opportunities which they never would have had in Europe. For others, the system of slavery brought an end to opportunity, freedom, and choice. This sharp contrast remained a part of America for a very long time. 1. Newcomers to America Learn these important terms: immigrants Scotch-lrish Pennsylvania Dutch Huguenots Remember the main idea: Immigrants came to America from many nations, and they came for different reasons. They brought new ideas and new ways of doing things. Look for answers to these questions: 1. From which European nations did settlers come? 2. Why did these settlers come to America? 3. What is an immigrant? Where did immigrants settle? During the 1600s, most of the settlers in the English colonies came from England. In general, those who were not English lived in the Dutch and Swedish colonies. These colonies were later taken over by the English. Thus, there were many Swedish settlers along the Delaware River and many Dutch settlers in New York. Toward the end of the 1600s, settlers from all over Europe started coming to the English colonies. These settlers were called immigrants (IM-uh-gruhnts). German Settlers During the 1600s, Germany suffered from many wars. These wars destroyed Chapter 5 83 Johan Prince (1592 1663) is remembered as the first governor of Pennsylvania. He governed the area from 1643 to 1653, when it was known as New Sweden. many farms and damaged trade and industry in Germany. At that time, Germany was not united under a single, powerful ruler. Instead, it was divided into hundreds of small states, each controlled by its own prince. Each German ruler taxed the people heavily. Often the ruler forced the people to attend the church he favored. For these reasons many wanted to leave Germany. And because the colonies offered a chance for a better life, many Germans wanted to settle in America. However, most did not have the money to pay for their passage. Therefore, they agreed to let ship captains take them to America and then sell them as indentured servants. They had to work for a master or mistress for four to seven years. After serving their time, they were free to start their new lives in America. In Germany and elsewhere in Europe, William Penn was advertising for settlers. Most German settlers were attracted by what Penn offered. They welcomed the opportunity to buy land cheaply and to worship as they wished. They settled in Pennsylvania in large numbers. Today descendants of these German settlers are still living in Pennsylvania and are known as Pennsylvania Dutch. Other Germans settled along the western frontier of the middle and southern colonies, where land was cheapest. Wherever they settled, most German immigrants became farmers. They took great pride in their farms and were among the best farmers in the colonies. The German settlers lived close together and kept their own language and customs. Think These decorative letters from the Ephrata ABC Book are fine examples of Pennsylvania German folk art. Respond How do they show the German settlers valued education? Scotch-Irish Settlers Another important group of immigrants who came to the English colonies were the Scotch-Irish. These settlers were descended from Scots who had moved to northern Ireland in the early 1600s. In Ireland, they had become farmers, cattle and sheep raisers, and woolen manufacturers. The Scotch-Irish had many troubles in Ireland, though. The English government refused to let them sell their goods in England. Also, the Scotch-Irish were members of the Presbyterian (prez-buh- TEER-ee-un) Church and not members of the Church of England. For this reason. they were not allowed to serve in the English government or the English army. But, they were forced to pay taxes to support the Church of England. These troubles led many Scotch-lrish people to immigrate to America during the 1700s. Like the Germans, many Scotch-lrish settlers came as indentured servants. They also settled first in Pennsylvania. Then some of them moved to the colonies in the South. Since few Scotch- lrish immigrants had money to buy land, however, most moved to unsettled land along the frontier. Scots Immigrants Another group of Scots, from the northern highlands of Scotland, also came to America. These Scots came because they did not like the English government. In 1707, the government of England and the governments of Scotland and Wales were joined together. They formed the kingdom of Great Britain. Some Scots were against the joining of the countries. They refused to accept the English ruler as their king. Twice the Scots tried to throw off England's rule. flunk England and Scotland became known as Great Britain in 1707. But many Highland Scots remained loyal co the Scottish throne. In 1745, the Highlanders revolted. Finally in 1746, the revolt ended when English troops won the decisive battle in Culloden Moor, shown here. Respond: How did this affect America? Chapter 5 85 Think: David and Phila Franks, shown here, were two of nine children in a Jewish family. Phila shocked her parents by marrying a Gentile. Respond: What family traditions would you find hard to change? After a rebellion in 1745, the Scottish clans, or large family groups, were broken up. The English took their lands from them. Many Scots immigrated to America at this time. Some came on their own, but others were forced to leave Scotland by the English government. The largest number of them settled in North Carolina. Most of the Scots were farmers, but others were merchants or skilled workers. French Settlers A small but important group of European immigrants who came to the English Think: Many people came to America to avoid religious persecution. These children were Huguenots, or French Protestants. Respond: What new ideas did these immigrants bring with them? colonies were Huguenots (HYOO-guh- nahtz). The Huguenots were French Protestants, or non-Catholic Christians. In the late 1600s, the little religious freedom that they once had was taken away. They were no longer allowed to worship as they wished in France. Nor were they allowed to settle in the French colonies. Some Huguenots left France and settled in the larger towns of the English colonies along the Atlantic coast. Many Huguenots became rich and important citizens. Immigrants Help the Colonies Grow People from many other nations in Europe also settled in the English colonies. Jews fleeing religious persecution came to America. Other people from Ireland, Wales, and Switzerland came to make a better living or to worship as they wished. These European immigrants— like later immigrants—were very important to the growth of America. Immigrants brought new and better ways of farming, trading, and manufacturing with them. They helped develop the American idea that people from all European nations were free and equal in America. Unfortunately, this freedom and equality did not extend to another group of people who came to America. Africans brought here against their will as slaves were not given freedom and equality. You will read about them in the next section. Section Review 1. Why did many German settlers come to America during the late 1600s? 2. Who were the Scotch-Irish? Where did they settle? 3. What brought French Huguenots to America? Reading Line Graphs If a colonial family wanted to record how much food they had stored for several winters, they might use a line graph similar to this one: v 500 ol 400 01 O •0 5 300 200 *■£ 100 0 Pounds of Foot by the Smith J Stored for Winter Family, 1770-1775 \ / \ / 1770 1771 1772 1773 1774 1775 The title of the graph tells what it is about. The numbers on the left of the graph stand for pounds of food. The numbers on the bottom of the graph tell the years. Sometimes these two locations for numbers on a graph are called the vertical axis and the horizontal axis. You can see that the Smith family had 400 pounds of food stored for the winters of 1770 and 1771. In 1772, the Smiths had 500 pounds stored. The graph shows that 1774 might have been a difficult winter for the family since only 200 pounds of food were stored. By the following winter, food storage had doubled to reach 400 pounds again. The line graph shows one way of recording information. It could help the Smith family compare their winter food storage year by year. The line graph below shows how the population of the colonies grew between 1650 and 1770. Look at the graph and answer these questions. Q What do the numbers on the left side of the graph stand for? 0 What do the numbers on the bottom of the graph stand for? 0 How many people were living in the colonies in 1650? In 1770?

Colonial Thought Learn these important terms: tutors academies literacy almanacs Great blue laws Awakening Remember the main idea: Most colonists knew how to read and were interested in books, newspapers, and education. Religion was also important to the colonists. Look for answers to these questions: 1. What kind of education did colonial children receive? 2. What were some of the earliest colleges built in the colonies? 3. What was the role of religion in the lives of the colonists? People coming to the colonies from England or Europe traveled on crowded ships. There was only enough space for passengers to bring things that would be useful in their new lives. The immigrants had to make tough choices. Yet, many colonists brought books with them to the new land. From the very beginning, education and books were highly valued in the colonies. People wanted their children to know how to read and write. Education in the Colonies upper class went to school. They attended private schools or church schools. For a time, this same idea was followed in the English colonies in America. Only upper- class children went to school. Many of them also went to private schools or church schools. Others had tutors, or private teachers, who taught them at home. Often, they were sent to English colleges to finish their education. At first, most colonial children who were not upper class did not go to school. Sometimes they were taught to read and write at the same time they were taught a trade. Girls seldom went to school. Instead, they stayed at home and were taught by their mothers to cook, sew, and care for children.

Respond: How did a girl's education compare to that of a boy? Chapter 6 107 3. The Frontier Learn these important terms: pioneers Bacon's Rebellion Regulators Appalachian Mountains Paxton Boys surplus Remember the main idea: The American frontier was settled by pioneer farmers who developed new ideas about freedom and equality. They often disagreed with the eastern colonists. Look for answers to these questions: 1. Who were the first people to settle the frontier? 2. What needs did the pioneers have that were not shared by the eastern colonists? 3. How did the frontier settlers win some of the things they wanted? The first settlers in the New World were pioneers, in a sense. They left the world they knew to forge new lives. They braved dangers both known and unknown. But when we speak of pioneers, we are usually referring to people who settled the American frontier. These people left the relative comfort of the cities and towns of the East. They moved to the back country, far away from other people, from supplies, from safety. They had to cope with loneliness, hostile Indians, and their own lack of knowledge about the land. In many ways, these pioneers were different from colonists in the East. Settling the Frontier In the 1600s, most of the Atlantic coast was covered with forests. At that time, this area was the frontier, or unsettled land, in the colonies. By the early 1700s, the frontier was only about 100 miles inland. But by 1775, the frontier was as far west as the Appalachian Mountains (AP-uh-LAY-chun). By this time, about 250,000 people lived on the frontier. At first, hunters and fur traders moved to the frontier. Later, they were followed by the colonists who settled the frontier lands—the pioneer farmers. Most pioneer farmers were European immigrants who settled in the western parts of the middle and southern colonies. They cut clearings in the forests and set up farms there. At first, they raised just enough food for themselves and their families. In time, however, pioneer farmers were able to grow more crops. Then they sold the surplus, or what they did not need, in the eastern part of the colonies. The Pioneer Life Most settlers on the frontier lived a different kind of life from colonists in the older settlements in the East. Frontier homes were smaller. Clothing and food were plainer, since pioneers had little chance to buy goods. Life was hard on the frontier. As a result, the settlers had to make their own rules for getting along from day to day. Scotch-Irish, Germans, and Scots worked together, and they began to feel equal to one another. However, they were not as wealthy as people in the East and did not feel that they were being treated equally by them. Differences Between Western and Eastern Colonists Distance made any communication between the frontier and the East difficult. factory in Massachusetts, he hired young, unmarried women from nearby farms. Lowell gave his workers clean, safe housing near the factory. He helped them save money for their families. After they worked for a few years, he wanted them to return to their farms and start their own families. Life for the "Lowell girls" was hard. But conditions in many other factories were worse. Work hours were long, and the wages were very low. Factories were often unsafe. Some workers tried to improve these conditions. The workers joined together into unions, or groups of workers who help each other. Sometimes these unions went on strike, or stopped work, to force factory owners to improve working conditions. The early unions were weak, however. Their strikes were usually unsuccessful. Conditions in most factories remained poor. As people moved to cities to work, they could not always find good places to live. Immigrants, or people from foreign countries, were also arriving in the cities. The cities grew so quickly that many problems arose in them. Working people often had to live in crowded slums. There were not enough police or firefighters. Streets and water were not always clean. Because of the Industrial Revolution, life in the Northeast changed in many ways. In the South and the West, however, the Industrial Revolution did not take hold. As you will read in the rest of this chapter, life in those sections changed in different ways. Section Review 1. What did Jefferson and Hamilton say about the way Americans should live and work? Whose vision turned out to be true? 2. Where and how did the Industrial Revolution begin? How did it reach the United States? 3. What important contributions did Eli Whitney make to American industry? 4. What was Lowell's plan for factory workers? What were working and living conditions like for most American factory workers? Chapter 11 237 Settlers and the Land 3. The West Learn these important terms: speculators turnpikes Erie Canal flatboat squatters National Road steamboat canal Remember the main idea: In the 1800s, the West became the largest and fastest growing section of the nation. Look for answers to these questions: 1. Why was travel to and from the West difficult? 2. What inventions and improvements made travel to the West easier? Americans usually moved to the West to find land. The states north of the Ohio River had good soil for farming. Farmers came from the eastern states and from Europe to settle there. Most of these settlers grew wheat and com. Much of the wheat was sold in the Northeast. The farmers used the com to feed their hogs and cattle. When the animals were fat, the farmers sold them in the Northeast. At first, the federal government owned most of the land in the West. The government sold some of this land to settlers. Sometimes the price was higher than poor settlers could afford. In 1785, for example, the government sold land for $1 an acre. However, settlers had to buy 640 acres. Many settlers could not afford $640 for land. However, speculators (SPEK-yoo-lay- turs), or people who buy land to resell it for a profit, could afford to buy the land. A speculator would buy a large piece of land for a dollar an acre. He or she would divide the land into small sections, then sell the sections to poor farmers for two or three dollars an acre. When early Americans talked about "the West," they could not always be sure about the meaning of the word. As the nation grew, the West kept moving westward. During the colonial years, the West was the unsettled land inland from the Atlantic coast. After the Revolutionary War, the West included lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. Later, after the Louisiana Purchase, the West included lands west of the Mississippi River. In the 1800s, the West became the largest and fastest growing section of the nation. In 1820, one-fourth of all Americans lived in the West. By 1840, one-third of the people living in the United States were Westerners. Think Leaving the Old Homestead, by James Wilkins, shows a family pulling up its roots and moving to the West. Respond: Why do you think this family decided to head west? New Americans When Franklin Pierce (1804-1869) was elected, he was dashing—the nation's youngest president. National conflicts during his term demanded his concentration, but Pierce's performance was marred by his grief over his son's death. A New Purchase In the election of 1852, the Democrats chose Franklin Pierce as their candidate. Pierce was a Northerner, but he was not an abolitionist. The Whigs chose General Winfield Scott, the Mexican War hero. Many southern Whigs left their party because they were angry at the northern, anti-slavery Whigs. As a result, the Whig party grew very weak. Pierce won the election with ease. During Pierce's term in office, the United States gained a small strip of land in the southern part of the New Mexico territory. The government wanted this land for a railroad line from New Orleans to California. The United States bought the land from Mexico in 1853 for ten million dollars. This deal was called the Gadsden Purchase (GADZ-dun). Winning new lands was not the only way in which the nation grew. In the 1840s and 1850s, many new immigrants came to the United States. Some came from England, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. A great famine in Ireland in 1846 brought thousands of Irish people to the United States. There was also a large number of German immigrants. In 1854 alone, over 400,000 immigrants arrived in the United States. Most of these immigrants settled in the North. Very few went to the South. The Irish stayed mainly in the cities of the Northeast. The Germans often moved to farms or cities in midwestern states, such as Wisconsin and Missouri. The new immigrants helped the United States grow in many ways. However, not all Americans welcomed them. Immigrants often stayed in their own groups and did not speak or dress like other Americans. Some Americans were upset by these differences. They blamed immigrants for the growth of slums. Some Americans also said that there was more crime in the cities because of the large number of immigrants. In the 1850s, Americans such as these formed a group that opposed the immigrants. The groups' members were called Think Below, Irish immigrants touch American soil for the first time as they leave their ship. Extremely poor because of a famine in Ireland, many Irish accepted the low wages they were offered. Respond: How are all workers affected when one group is willing to work for very low wages? Think: Know-Nothings formed a secret society against immigrants. They formed a political party, which backed Millard Fillmore in an unsuccessful 1856 campaign. Above, a mob of Know-Nothings tears through the streets of Boston. Respond Why were the Know-Nothings afraid of immigrants? Know-Nothings because they wanted their group to be secret. When anyone asked a member about the group, the member would answer, "I know nothing." The Know-Nothings tried to end immigration and to keep immigrants from becoming citizens and voting. They formed a political party and were strong for a few years, but their party soon died out. The growth of the nation in the 1840s and 1850s made the United States one of the largest nations in the world. This growth also caused the slavery problem to worsen. Leaders such as Henry Clay worked hard to hold the nation together. But the compromises of these leaders could not solve the slavery problem once and for all. Within a few years, the conflict | between the North and the South led to war. In the next chapter, you will read about this terrible war. Section Review 1.

Chapter 14 315 Think Chinese workers building the Central Pacific Railroad used the simplest of tools, Notice the handcarts used to carry din to fill in a gap between two mountains. The stronger din bridge will replace the wooden one. Respond: How do these working conditions compare to those of today? Mining camps were wild, lawless places. Stealing and murder were common. There was no government or police force. Even in the towns, miners often had to control crime themselves. When things got out of hand, the citizens of the town formed committees to restore law and order. Members of the committees were called vigilantes. The vigilantes captured criminals, gave them quick trials, and punished them. The punishment was usually death by hanging. Booms towns went up fast, but many did not survive long. When the mines gave out, boom towns often turned into ghost towns. Only towns along major transportation routes continued to thrive. The 1880s brought an end to gold fever. Although few miners got rich, many stayed to settle land in Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota. The Transcontinental Railroad Miners and other groups of settlers helped open the West. But it was the railroad that filled the frontier with people. President Abraham Lincoln believed that America needed railroads. He wanted to build a railroad that would connect the East with the West, all the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. In 1862, Congress approved plans to build a transcontinental railroad. Two railroad companies were chosen to build this railroad. In 1863, the Union Pacific Railroad began building westward from Omaha, Nebraska. The Central j Pacific Railroad built eastward from Sac- i ramento, California. The Union Pacific employed thousands I of Irish immigrants. Ten thousand Chi- I nese immigrants worked for the Central I Pacific. Laying track was difficult work I Think A crowd watched as a golden spike joined the Union Pacific and Central Pacific. Posters announced the first ride on the new line. Respond: What changes would a transcontinental railroad bring? In 1869, the two railroads joined at Promontory, Utah. The two railroad crews came together for a great celebration. Railroad officials drove in the spike connecting the two rails. The spike was made of gold, and the hammer was of silver. The first east-to-west railroad across the United States was finally completed. Thousands of people, eager to be miners, ranchers, and farmers, quickly poured into the West. * r*umui nut"i utti_ lunrawciH nt ANffTCftA for both railroad crews. The Irish workers faced Indian raids, summer heat, and the cold winters of the plains. The Chinese workers had to lay track through the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In freezing temperatures, they dug railroad tunnels through the mountains. Snowstorms left snow drifts up to fifty feet high. Many workers lost their lives when snowslides struck. In spite of these hardships, the Chinese were able to work quickly. They set a world record by laying ten miles of track in one day! Section Review 1. What was the Comstock Lode? 2.

The Growth of American Industries During the years between 1865 and 1900, the United States changed very rapidly. It changed from a farming nation into an industrial nation. New factories sprang up in cities and towns. Miles and miles of new railroads were built. None of these changes would have been possible without the American people. The population was growing quickly. Between 1865 and 1900, twelve million immigrants poured into America from Europe and Asia. And these new Americans were ambitious. They wanted to work hard and become successful. As you will see as you read this chapter, success in America was not achieved by all. A few Americans built huge industries and became quite wealthy. Other Americans earned very little money. And some Americans invented things that made life and the development of industry easier for all. Learn these important terms: consumer goods heavy industry corporation capital raw materials Bessemer process stockholders Remember the main idea: The rapid growth of industry after 1865 turned the United States into a great industrial nation. Look for answers to these questions: 1. Why did heavy industry grow rapidly after 1865? 2. Why were natural resources and a large population important to industrial growth? 3. How did new inventions help the growth of industry? Before 1865, most American factories made consumer goods (kuhn-SOO-muhr). These products were sold directly to the public, the consumers. Clothing and shoe factories, meat-packing plants, and flour mills produced consumer goods. Most of these factories were small and hired only a few workers. In the late 1850s, heavy industry began to grow. Heavy industries produced machinery, iron rails, and engines. These products were bought by other factories or other industries. The Civil War helped both the consumer goods and the heavy industries to grow. Factories Chapter 18 385 Very high quality iron ore came from Min* nesota and Michigan. Oil, which was first used for lighting and greasing machinery, was discovered in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Lumber came from the nation's forests. America was rich in another resource. The United States had a large and growing population. There seemed to be an endless supply of workers for the factories. Many of these workers came to the United States as immigrants. Others were Americans who had moved from farms to cities to find jobs. Still others were southern blacks moving north in search of better opportunities. Capital and Corporations Business leaders needed large amounts of money, or capital, to build factories, dig coal from the ground, or mine iron ore. The federal government encouraged the growth of industries by keeping taxes low. And Americans and wealthy people from other countries provided the capital that was needed. Usually, these individuals invested their money in a new type of business organization called a corporation. A corporation is a company that is owned by many people called stockholders. They buy stocks, or shares, of the company. After 1865. many corporations were formed. These large businesses were important to the growth of American industry. Inventors Railroads, raw materials, workers, and capital made America's industries grow. But America also had another important resource—many talented inventors and scientists. These clever individuals invented labor-saving machines and new products. They improved methods of manufacturing. The inventions of the late 1800s changed American industries and American life. One of the most important early inventions was a new method for making steel. A tougher metal than iron, steel had been too costly to make. In 1856. two inventors. working separately, developed a new and cheaper way to make it. They Think This picture from an advertisement for the H.C. Frick Coke Company shows coal being mined.

Problems of American Workers Learn these important terms: skilled workers Chinese Exclusion Act unskilled workers old immigrants new immigrants Remember the main idea: Between 1865 and 1900, unskilled workers received low wages and worked long hours. Many immigrants and blacks were among these unskilled workers. Look for answers to these questions: 1. Why was life hard for unskilled workers during the late 1800s? 2. From where did most immigrants come during the late 1800s? 3. What problems did black workers face? America's workers in the late 1800s were divided into two groups. They were the skilled workers and the unskilled workers. Skilled workers had learned trades and were printers, carpenters, bricklayers, and machinists. They usually earned high wages and enjoyed good working conditions. Unskilled workers had no skills and little education. Many unskilled workers ran machines in factories. These jobs required little skill and offered low wages. Unskilled workers were paid by the hour. Think: These unskilled Russian immigrants worked in the steel industry. Respond: What were the benefits and problems brought on by immigrants' willingness to work for low pay? They earned about four hundred dollars a year and usually worked ten hours a day for six days a week. When business was slow, the unskilled workers were the first to be fired. Immigrant Workers Many of the unskilled workers were immigrants. Since many Chinese immigrants helped build the railroads, they settled in large communities in the West. Here, they continued to be labeled unskilled workers. Other immigrants came from all over Europe and settled throughout America. Many German and Scandinavian farmers settled on land in the Midwest. Immigrants with skills and those too poor to buy a farm stayed in the cities of the Northeast. They took whatever jobs they could get and were willing to work for low wages. These immigrants dug ditches, paved roads, and mined coal. They worked in meat-packing plants and textile mills. They did the heavy work in the iron and steel mills. k Think Women worked in industries, such as this candy factory where chocolate eggs were made. Respond How did hiring women affect the wages paid by factories in the late 1800s? In the 1880s, more immigrants began to arrive from the countries of southern and eastern Europe. Many of these immigrants were from Italy, Russia, Hungary, and Poland. These groups of people became known as the new immigrants. Immigrants from the countries in northern and western Europe were called the old immigrants. The new immigrants accepted the very low wages factory owners offered them. The older group of workers from northern and western Europe disliked the newcomers. They felt that the new immigrants took away their jobs and made wages lower. Other Americans became concerned about the steady stream of new immigration into the country. These Americans believed that the new immigrants tended to stay together longer and to adopt American ways more slowly than the earlier immigrants. They became concerned that their American way of life and their values were being threatened by too many foreigners. Groups of Americans who wanted to restrict immigration started to organize. Their first target was the Chinese. In the 1870s, riots against the Chinese broke out in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Denver. And in 1882. Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. This law stopped Chinese immigration. After 1882, Congress continued to pass laws that restricted immigration. Think Political cartoons illustrated the fears that many Americans had about the number of immigrants entering the country Respond- Were these fears justified? Explain.

The Growth of American Cities Learn these important terms: tenements sanitation Remember the main idea: Immigrants and Americans who moved away from the farms helped cities grow rapidly after 1865. Overcrowding in the cities caused many problems. Look for answers to these questions: 1. What made cities grow rapidly in the late 1800s? 2. Where did most of America's immigrants settle? 3. How did a fast-growing population cause problems in the cities of America? The population of the United States more than doubled between 1860 and 1900. In the late 1890s, a new wave of immigrants arrived on the shores of America. They came to the teeming cities of America to escape poverty, tyranny, and starvation. They came with families or alone, almost always without skills or money. For most immigrants, life in America was a difficult adjustment. In this chapter, you will see the problems immigrant families faced as they began new lives in America. You will read about some attempts to solve these problems. You will also read about other Americans. You will read about the farmers who moved to the cities. You will read about the more fortunate Americans as well. As you read about the people, you will learn about many changes in their lives. Cities changed as people's needs changed. This affected the American way of life. More leisure time also affected Americans. You will read about some new interests Americans discovered. In the years after 1865, American cities started to grow very rapidly. In 1860, there were approximately six million people living in city areas. That number was 16 percent of all Americans. By 1900, almost 40 percent of the population, more than thirty million people, lived in cities. Cities did not grow at the same rate all over the United States. The fastest growing cities were in the Northeast and the Middle West. New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia were the largest cities, with populations in the millions. Many cities grew because they were transportation centers. Chicago grew rapidly because it was a major railroad center, and Philadelphia and St. Louis were Chapter 19 403 Think: This 1880 cartoon by Joseph Keppler shows immigrants arriving in the United States. Notice the signs posted for the immigrants to read. When the cartoon was created, immigrants were still accepted. Soon after, things changed. Respond: Why did things change? located on rivers. Many of the fast-grow- ing cities were also located near the natural resources needed by industry. The rich iron ore deposits near Lake Superior in Michigan made Detroit a center of iron and steel manufacturing. Iron and coal from the Appalachian Mountains fed the steelmaking plants of Pittsburgh. As the new industrial cities grew, more workers were needed for the factories and mills. Large industries drew many job- seekers to the cities. One group of people looking for work in the cities came from the farms of America. It had become difficult to make a living in farming. By the late 1800s, farm machines had replaced many farm workers. Prices for farm products were low, and many farmers were so deeply in debt that they lost their farms. Tens of thousands of farm families sadly left their homes and moved to the cities. There they hoped to earn more money and find an easier life. Immigrants Make the Cities Grow By the end of the 1800s, foreigners were a large part of the population of any big city. They were the twelve million immigrants who arrived in the United States between 1865 and 1900. Most immigrants settled in the cities of the Northeast or Middle West. The largest group settled in New York City. Many immigrants arrived at New York Harbor without money, and they could not afford to travel farther. The immigrants in the big cities chose to settle with people like themselves. City life was a colorful mixture of nationalities. Each neighborhood—Polish, Greek, Italian, Jewish—could be easily identified by the clothing, the shop signs, and the language spoken. The neighborhood streets became the center for almost all daytime activity. Men, women, and children escaped to the streets from their tiny, dark rented rooms. There they could find pushcarts filled with vegetables, fruits, pots and pans, and clothing. Families also used the neighborhood streets to visit with friends. And the streets served as playgrounds for the children. Life in immigrant neighborhoods was very hard. Immigrants earned such low wages that everyone in the family had to work. Children worked long hours alongside their parents at the factories. Some children worked all day in windowless rooms surrounded by dangerous machinery. Other children worked at home with their parents, sewing clothing or making small items to sell. Problems of the Cities As cities grew and neighborhoods became more crowded, many new problems developed. Poor people were forced to live in slums, or run-down city neighborhoods. The slums spread rapidly as tenements (TEN-uh-ments) were built to house the continual flood of newcomers. Tenements were usually wooden buildings five or six stories high that were divided into tiny rooms. They were poorly built and poorly maintained. Large families often crowded together in one-room apartments. Many tenement apartments had no windows, heat, or water. Some tenement residents collected water in buckets from public pumps in the streets. Wells under the streets held the water supply. However, this water was often polluted by garbage from the Think: Living and working conditions for many immigrants were not as easy as they had hoped. This photograph shows a family making a living by sewing clothes. Notice how small their home is and that all members of the family worked. Respond: How does the life of this family differ from family life today? u iu# ap quaa s a s When you compare the two maps below, you will find direct information about the growth of cities in the United States between 1860 and 1900. You can then go on to use the text to help you to infer additional information. (When you draw an inference, you come to a conclusion based upon all the general information you were able to gather.) For example, you could infer why some cities grew up where they did, or why some cities grew larger than others. Look at the map of cities in 1860. 1. How many cities had a population of over one million people in 1860? How many had over 100,000? 2. How many of these large cities were in the South? How many were in the West? Now look at the map of cities in 1900. 3. How many cities had over one million people? Which cities are they? Which of these cities grew the most in forty years? 4. How many cities were over 100,000?

The living conditions shown here were typical of many immigrant sections of large cities. Notice the number of people cramped together. Respond: What problems were caused by this overcrowding? streets. This lack of sanitation, or clean and healthful conditions, caused outbreaks of disease. In the overcrowded living conditions of the tenements, illnesses spread rapidly. Many people died from smallpox and other serious diseases. Crime also spread rapidly through the tenement neighborhoods. Most immigrant families struggled daily to get by, even with every member of the family working. Many adults and children were often unemployed, and sometimes homeless as well. With so many people living so closely together, stealing was a constant problem for many slum dwellers.

Cities Try To Solve Their Problems Learn these important terms: political machine settlement house party boss Hull House Remember the main idea: During the late 1800s, overcrowding caused many problems in the cities. Both city governments and private groups tried to solve some of these problems. Look for answers to these questions: 1. What did city governments do to improve services in the city? 2. Who ran the city governments? 3. How did private groups help poor people in the cities? Think: The Great Chicago Fire raged for 24 hours, wiping out the city's central business district. The fire destroyed over 17,000 buildings, leaving 90.000 homeless and consuming 200 million dollars worth of property. Respond: What positive changes did this destructive fire help bring about? dk r------- Ml ,;i On the night of October 8, 1871, a fire broke out in Chicago. A high wind spread the blaze from building to building until the central part of the city was a mass of flames. This fire destroyed seventeen thousand buildings. It killed more than three hundred people and left ninety thousand homeless. The Great Chicago Fire, as it came to be known, called attention to the problems of city life. Tens of thousands of immigrants and farmers were flooding the city. They could only afford to live in seriously overcrowded areas. This overcrowding led to the danger of not only fire, but also of disease and crime. Improvements in City Services Solving these problems presented a major challenge to city governments. After the Chicago fire, cities realized that they could no longer depend on volunteers to fight fires. They organized fire departments staffed with trained firefighters. They also bought fire engines and other firefighting equipment. Poor sanitation was a more difficult problem to solve. City-owned waterworks replaced neighborhood wells, but city water was still not always fit to drink. Counmy of Chiemgo Hlvturicat SoeMy Dusty, dirty streets were also a health hazard. In the late 1800s, many cities started to pave their streets with bricks or asphalt. These materials were easier to clean than dirt or cobblestone streets. Crime ranked as a major city problem. To make city streets safer during the 1880s, many cities replaced gas and oil lamps with electric streetlights. Electric lighting proved to be one of the most important improvements in city life. New Transportation Helps Cities To Grow Electricity also helped to solve the problem of transportation within cities that were rapidly expanding. Horse- drawn streetcars were too expensive, too slow, and too small to carry large numbers of passengers. By 1895, most large cities had replaced these horse-drawn cars with electric streetcars. Soon subways and elevated railway lines, called els, were built in some cities. These new ways to travel were fast and cheap, and they allowed cities to expand more rapidly. People could travel to work from areas farther away from the central city. For this reason, wealthy and middle- class people began moving out to newer, more expensive neighborhoods. The city was no longer the only place to live. However, for some people there was no choice. Newly arrived immigrants and the poorest people became more concentrated in the older central districts. Dishonesty in Big City Government New fire departments, waterworks, paved streets, electric streetlights, and transportation systems did improve city life somewhat. However, they did not do enough. For one thing, the problems of growing cities were overwhelming. For another, many big city governments were mn by corrupt, or dishonest, officials. Think: The electric streetcar above moves through the uncrowded Chicago suburb of Oak Park. Respond: How did the electric streetcar influence where people could live and work? Think: The elevated railroad ran on tracks above the ground, easing the crowded conditions on the roads below. Respond: Why were new forms of transportation needed in cities? These officials stayed in office by making deals with a political machine. A political machine was a smoothly run political organization. It was usually headed by a party boss, or strong party leader. The machine controlled city government by guaranteeing votes for officials. In return for these votes, the city officials awarded contracts for city services to friends or members of the machine. For example, a city might be planning to pave its streets or put in new sewer lines. Businesspeople interested in these contracts might pay the local machine Chapter 19 409 thousands of dollars. The machine would then use its influence with city officials to get the city contract for them. And at election time, the machine also had influence. It would get certain officials elected with thousands of immigrant votes. To get these votes, the political machine provided many needed services for immigrants. The machine fed people when they were hungry. It found them jobs when they were out of work. It provided coal for people who could not afford it. Sometimes the machine even paid for boys from immigrant families to go to college or trade schools. To show their appreciation, immigrants voted for candidates supported by the machine. Although it was a bad influence on city government, the machine did help poor immigrant families meet their daily needs. With its money, votes, and power, the political machine was almost impossible to beat in elections in most cities. Helping the Poor Even the machines could not take care of everyone's needs. One of the most difficult problems in the cities was easing the suffering of the poor and homeless. Immigrant families had to survive on the low wages they earned in the factories. When times were bad and factories laid off workers, many families suffered. During these times, thousands of people were left homeless. City governments did not have enough employees or money to solve these problems. The political machines helped only those people who supported them. Private groups, such as churches and charities, did provide some help for the poor. The most effective attempt to help the poor was the settlement house. A settlement house provided services for immigrants in their own neighborhoods. It offered English classes, taught job skills, and provided medical care. One of its StMk DFfe Trir '"v Think: In 1889, Jane Addams (left) founded Hull House (photographed here in 1910) to help Chicago's immigrants.

The most famous settlement house was started by Jane Addams. She was a college graduate who wanted to make life better for those who were less fortunate. In 1889, Jane Addams set up a settlement house in Chicago. This house, called Hull House, served as a model for other settlement houses throughout the country. Section Review 1.

Clarity, humor, and the use of truly American language mark his work. America's most famous realistic writer was Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel L. Clemens. In 1884, Twain wrote his best-known book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This novel describes the friendship between a young boy and a runaway slave. Americans read more in the late 1800s because they had more free time and were better educated. Between 1865 and 1900, an increasing number of American children attended public schools. Many states passed laws that required all children to attend elementary schools for a certain number of years. Section Review 1. How did new inventions help change women's lives?

These schools taught immigrants to speak English. They also taught immigrants the rights and duties of American citizens.

Respond: Why did so many people want to become American citizens? Chapter 19 415 of its members were farmers. Other workers also supported the new third party. Many people who felt that big business was too powerful also joined. In 1892, the Populists decided to run a candidate for president. They nominated James B. Weaver of Iowa. The Populists did not win the presidential election. However, they elected three governors, five senators, and ten members of the House of Representatives. A Strong Populist Program The Populists wanted to reform the government. These were the most important changes they wanted to make: 1. Government ownership and operation of all railroad and telegraph systems. Populists wanted these systems to be run in the best interests of the people. 2. A graduated income tax. Populists wanted people who earned higher incomes to pay a larger percentage in taxes. In 1892, everyone paid an income tax of 2 percent. 3. Voting by secret ballot. In many states, how a person voted was public information. Populists wanted this to end. 4. Direct election of senators. Populists wanted voters, not state legislatures, to elect senators. 5. Limits to immigration. Populists especially wanted to limit those immigrants they felt were "undesirable." 6. An eight-hour day for workers. 7.

Bryan was a strong supporter of this free coinage of silver. The Republican candidate was William McKinley of Ohio. He was backed by wealthy business leaders and bankers. Large amounts of campaign money helped McKinley win the election. Although the Populists did not win this election, many of their ideas were eventually accepted by both the Democratic and Republican parties. Section Review 1. What problems did farmers have?

In 1919, many groups of workers went on strike for higher wages and better working conditions. At first, these strikes were successful. Then factory owners fought back. They often got the government to help them put down strikes. When coal and steel workers went on strike, the factory owners refused to talk to them. Instead, they asked for injunctions, or court orders, to end the strikes. Problems for Unions By the end of 1923, good times had returned to the nation. Factories ran at full capacity again. Expanding businesses needed more workers to meet the demand for consumer goods. Skilled workers could find plenty of high-paying jobs. Some companies began to treat workers better. They offered higher wages, a shorter workday, paid vacations, and pension plans. All of these things made skilled workers lose interest in unions. Some companies, feeling that unions could no longer hurt them, simply refused to hire union workers. In turn, unions became weaker and had a hard time fighting back. Unskilled workers did not share in improved working conditions. Many still worked twelve-hour days and earned low wages. Most blacks and Mexican-Ameri- cans, when they could get jobs at all, could only get unskilled work.

In this chapter you will read about some Americans' efforts to stop the flow of immigrants to America. They disliked the immigrants' foreign languages and customs. They also feared losing their jobs to the newcomers. Meanwhile, as blacks continued to struggle for their rights, some whites fought to keep them segregated, or separate from whites, and under control. New ideas also met with resistance. Music, writing, and art expressed thoughts and feelings that challenged old beliefs. Science offered a new picture of the world and human life. Many scientific discoveries disturbed people with traditional ideas. At the same time, however, others were excited by the new ideas. Young people found they had new freedom. Women declared their independence in the ways they dressed and acted. The pulsing rhythms of jazz music filled the air. The 1920s became known as "the Jazz Age." 1. New Americans and Old Fears Learn these important terms: Universal Negro Improvement Association quota system Communists anarchists Remember the main idea: After World War I, many Americans feared people different from themselves. As a result, immigration was restricted during the 1920s. Blacks continued to run into obstacles in their struggle for freedom. Look for answers to these questions: 1. What led to the restriction of immigration in the 1920s? 2. What approaches did blacks take in their struggle for freedom? 3. What did the Ku Klux Klan try to do? Was it successful? The United States is often called a nation of immigrants. Between 1820 and 1890 about fifteen million immigrants came to America. They were mostly Irish, Germans, and other people from countries of northern Europe. Immigrants were not always welcomed right away. Some Americans looked down on them because of their foreign customs. Gradually, however, these groups of European immigrants became part of American society. On the other hand, people from completely unfamiliar cultures were not readily accepted. By the 1870s, Chapter 26 533 1.300.000 1.100.000 900.000 700.000 | 500.000 i 300.000 100.000 igoo 1915 1930 years ■3 also came from Italy, eastern Europe, and Greece. About a million Jews arrived from eastern Europe, many fleeing religious persecution. Like the Asians who had come earlier, many of these new groups of immigrants did not fit easily into American society. Their languages and cultures were quite different from those Americans already knew. New immigrants often kept to themselves and lived together in their own communities. Since they did not become Americanized quickly, the new immigrants often faced discrimination. about 100,000 Chinese had come to America. These people faced anti-Chi- nese riots in some western cities. And in 1882, Congress passed a law preventing further immigration from China. In 1910, Japanese immigration was also halted. About 130,000 Japanese had come to America by that time. Between 1890 and 1924 a great new wave of immigrants, more than twenty million of them, came to America. Some of these immigrants came from northern and western Europe. But huge numbers Think Nearing the end of their journey, immigrants attempt to get a glimpse of their new home. Respond: What reasons might these immigrants give for coming to America? Closing the Gate In the early 1920s, anti-immigrant feelings grew stronger. Several things contributed to this dislike and fear of foreigners. During World War I, the government encouraged support for the war by picturing Germans as evil brutes. While this attitude helped the war effort, it also encouraged a dislike of people from non- Allied countries. After the war ended, there was a time of high unemployment and labor troubles. Many Americans feared losing their jobs to immigrants who would work longer hours for lower wages. Responding to this anti-immigration feeling. Congress in 1921 set up a quota system. This law limited the number of immigrants entering the country each year. In 1924, Congress passed an even stricter law. This law limited immigration levels to those recorded over thirty years earlier. Immigrants from each country could not number more than they did in 1890. Thus, the number of immigrants coming from southern and eastern Europe was even more restricted. A 1929 law adjusted these quotas to make them more fair. But this law also reduced the total number of immigrants per year to only 150,000. Asians still were kept out almost completely. Think: Artist Ben Shahn made his mark with this painting. The Prisoners Sacco and Vanzetti The trial and execution of these two anarchists caused an uproar throughout America. The evidence against the men was only circumstantial, not solid. Respond: Had Sacco and Vanzetti not been immigrants and anarchists, how might they have been treated? The Red Scare In 1917, a revolution in Russia had brought Communists, or "Reds" as they came to be called, to power. The Communists wanted to overthrow present governments and replace them with a new system of organizing society. They felt a few rich people controlled industries, and they wanted the government to run all businesses for the benefit of workers. The Communists called for a worldwide revolution to bring about these changes. Even before 1917, some Communists had immigrated to the United States. Anarchists, revolutionaries who did not believe in having any type of government at all, also entered the United States. After World War I, some Americans feared that Communists or anarchist immigrants were trying to take over the country. They blamed the labor troubles of the early 1920s on "foreign agitators." Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer even claimed that there was a plot to destroy America. On New Year's Day 1920, he had the police round up about six thousand people from thirty-three cities. There was little evidence against most of these people, and most of them were later released without trial. When the predicted revolution did not come. Palmer's influence on government faded. Many people still wanted to isolate America from foreigners, however. Sacco and Vanzetti In 1920, two Italian immigrants, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, were accused of killing a man during a robbery. Not only were they foreigners, but they were also anarchists. Sacco and Vanzetti seemed to symbolize the worst fears of some Americans. They were tried and sent to the electric chair. Many people felt they were innocent and had not received a fair trial. These people saw Sacco and Vanzetti as victims of the Red Scare. Chapter 26 535 i. The Muteum of Modem An. Return of the Ku Klux Klein Think: The original Ku Klux Ktan died out after southern whites regained control of their governments. But when fear and anger toward immigrants grew in the early 1900s, the organization reappeared in 1915. Respond: Why did many Americans disagree with the Klan's methods? groups were not very successful, however. Many blacks turned to a new group called the Universal Negro Improvement Association, or U.N.I.A. It was led by a Jamaican immigrant, Marcus Garvey. He said that it was impossible for blacks ever to win their rights in America. He said that blacks should be proud of their culture and history. Garvey wanted blacks to return to Africa to build a new country there. Although his project failed, many blacks welcomed his message of pride. Garvey's plan pleased some whites who wanted to drive blacks out of the country. Their dislike of blacks and immigrants provided support for a new Ku Klux Klan. The original Klan was started by some southern whites to control blacks after the Civil War. The new Klan was started in 1915. By 1925 there were almost five million Klan members all over the United States. Their targets were Catholics, Jews, immigrants, and especially blacks. They used whippings, cross-burnings, even murder to frighten these people. They held big marches and gained political power in several southern states. But most Americans, even those who agreed with some of the Klan's ideas, did not support their violent methods. Their leaders fought among themselves. By the end of the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had lost most of its power. The Klan seemed like a remnant of an earlier America. All around it. American life was changing in many different ways. You will read about these changes in the next section. Section Review 1. How were the later groups of immigrants different from the early ones? 2. What was the purpose of the immigration laws passed during the 1920s? 3. What problems did blacks face in the 1920s? What were two strategies they developed to deal with them? 4. Who were the targets of the new Ku Klux Klan? How did most Americans respond to the Klan? Think Thomas Hart Benton painted Contemporary America (portion shown above) in 1930. He meant the mural to show real people in real situations of the 1920s. He included his wife and son (middle bottom) and himself (standing, bottom right). Respond What popular activities of the 1920s are depicted? A National Culture The new American culture emerging in the 1920s came about because of new ideas and new ways of spreading them. Radio networks began to bring the same issues and ideas to people all over the country. People often heard about news events while they were still happening, rather than days later. People all over the country watched the same movies and played the same records. Heroes like Babe Ruth and Charles Lindbergh did not belong to one city or state, but to the whole country. Americans still had differences. For example, farmers and city dwellers still had very different ways of life. Many blacks, Asians, and Hispanic Americans felt rejected by an America that seemed to be for whites only. Some parts of American life had changed, but others had not. As you read the next section, you will see how artists and educators felt about the changes in American life during the Roaring Twenties. Section Review 1. How did life change for many American women in the 1920s? 2. How did entertainment change in the 1920s? 3. What did Charles Lindbergh represent to Americans? 4. What helped create a new, widespread American culture? In 1925, Ms. West was a German emigrant and an American immigrant. To be sure which country the woman moved from and which country she moved to, you can refer to a dictionary. Look at the dictionary entries below. The word emigrant is listed first, because it comes before immigrant in alphabetical order. In parentheses after each entry word is a respelling that shows how to pronounce the word. The letter n. that follows shows that each word is a noun. The definitions of the words and the sample sentence help you see that Ms. West is an emigrant from Germany, or has left Germany.

Groups with Special Problems Learn these important terms: Dust Bowl Rural Electrification Administration Black Cabinet Indian Reorganization Act Remember the main idea: During the Great Depression, falling prices and natural disasters made life especially hard for farmers. Women were discriminated against but held onto traditional "women's jobs." Blacks and other minorities suffered even more than whites during the depression, but some New Deal programs helped these groups. Look for answers to these questions: 1. What special problems did farmers have during the depression? 2. What happened to women who tried to seek work? 3. What gains and losses did minority groups have during the Great Depression? White men in America's cities suffered badly during the depression. Other Americans, however, suffered even more. Farmers, whether white or black, had special problems. Women, blacks, and other minorities still faced unfairness as they tried to compete with white men for work. Special Problems of Farmers Prices for farm products were very low during the depression. Some farmers were so angry and discouraged that they destroyed what they had grown rather than trying to sell it. They burned crops, slaughtered healthy pigs and cattle, and poured milk onto roadways. This was an especially painful sight to those who knew that people were starving in the cities of America. A natural disaster, in addition to falling prices, destroyed many farmers' way of life. From 1932 to 1939, a long spell of dry weather and high winds turned Kansas, Oklahoma, and other midwestem states into what was known as a Dust Bowl. Wheat and other farm crops did not hold down topsoil the way the prairie grasses had. When the winds came, the soil simply blew away. Unable to grow more crops, more farmers than ever lost their farms. Many of the homeless came from Oklahoma. "Okies," as they were called, packed everything they had into the family car and headed for the far West. There they hoped to find jobs. Often they found nothing but disappointment and harsh treatment when they arrived. As migrant workers, they went from farm to farm, searching for a day's work. They lived in makeshift shacks or in their cars. Sharecroppers and tenant farmers also had special problems. Most of these were blacks living in the South. They worked on farms owned by others. They were supposed to get part of the profits from the crops they grew. Often, however, the money was completely used up in paying rent for the land or in buying the seeds and tools they needed. When the Agricultural Adjustment Administration told farmers to cut back crops, many farm owners forced most of their tenants or sharecroppers off the land. Some government agencies did try to help these groups. There were experiments with buying land and giving it as homesteads to people who had been tenant farmers. The Farm Security Administration set up clean camps for migrant workers. And the Rural Electrification Administration, or REA, gave loans to farm cooperatives so that inexpensive electric power could be brought to farms. Electricity brought lights and appliances that eased the burden of life for those who had managed to keep their farms. Think The work of artist Ben Shahn is filled with social statements. Shahn was a social realist. He portrayed things as harshly as he saw them. At the same time. Shahn wanted things to be better. Respond: Why was it important for artists to record what they saw and felt during the Great Depression? Think Throughout the Great Plains, farm families had to make tough choices. Abandoned farms dotted the Dust Bowl. Many farmers moved west, hoping to find work. Some stayed, only to watch their farm land be reduced to dust. Respond What caused a large portion of the Great Plains to become a dust bowl? Chapter 28 577 Black Cabinet gave blacks a voice in the Roosevelt administration. One member, Mary McLeod Bethune, worked especially hard to get jobs and education for young blacks. Because of the help they received, many blacks became supporters of Roosevelt and the Democratic Party. Other Minorities In the 1920s, many immigrants from Mexico had worked on farms in the Southwest. These jobs became more in demand in the 1930s, however. To cut down on job competition, the government forced between a quarter million and a half million "Mexicans" to move to Mexico. Some of these people were really citizens of the United States. Indians had even worse luck finding work during the depression than did blacks or Mexican-Americans. They did make one gain during the New Deal days, however. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 stopped the government policy of dividing reservations into small parcels of farm land. It also recognized the Indians as tribes and gave them a little more say over their future. The approval of this act showed that Americans finally were gaining respect for the Indians' traditional way of life. Section Review 1. What caused the natural disaster that destroyed many midwestern farms in 1934 and 1935? 2. What kinds of jobs were women able to keep during the Great Depression? 3. How did the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 show recognition of the Indians' traditional way of life? 3. Entertainment find the Arts in the 1930s Learn these important terms: musicals swing music Remember the main idea: People found inexpensive ways to entertain themselves and forget their troubles during the 1930s. Serious writers and artists explored the causes and sufferings of the Great Depression. Look for answers to these questions: 1. What kinds of movies and radio shows did people enjoy in the 1930s? 2. What plays and novels described problems in particular parts of the country? 3. How did the government help writers and artists during the depression? Whether they wanted it or not, many Americans in the 1930s found themselves with more free time than ever before. As businesses cut back work to save money, the five-day work week became common. People without jobs, of course, had no work week at all. People looked for inexpensive ways to amuse themselves and raise their spirits during their free time. Many people turned to bicycling, softball, and other sports. New Deal work projects built many new public swimming pools, playgrounds, and other places for Think: During World War II. 100,000 Japanese-Americans were taken from their homes. Respond: What do you suppose these people were thinking as they were taken to relocation camps? Black leaders were able to take advantage of the need for labor. They pressured the government to end discrimination. They also pointed out that America had declared war on Hitler's racism. Wasn't it time to end racism at home as well? Responding to this pressure, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802. This order made it unlawful for any factory producing war supplies to refuse to hire workers because of their race, color, or religion. A Fair Employment Practices Commission was formed to see that this order was carried out. While this effort was not completely successful, the end of the war saw about two million black workers in factories. Japanese-Americans Are Mistreated The anger Americans felt after the Pearl Harbor attack helped the war effort. Many Americans did not wait to be drafted, but volunteered to fight in the war. Government posters urged Americans to "Remember Pearl Harbor'' and work hard every day. This anger hurt one group of Americans, however. German-Americans and Italian-Americans were usually not blamed for the actions of Hitler and Mussolini. Japanese-American citizens, or Nisei, however, were treated very differently. Pearl Harbor inflamed the racist feelings that some Americans had toward Japanese. Some Americans also were afraid that the Japanese-Americans were spying for Japan and secretly trying to damage the war effort. As a result, more than 100,000 Nisei were rounded up and put into special camps. Despite this mistreatment, the Nisei showed their loyalty to America. Thousands of Nisei were allowed to fight against the Germans. Many of them received medals for bravery. Raising Money for the War World War II cost more than any other war in American history. From 1941 to 1945, the United States government spent about $400 billion to pay for the war. This huge amount was more than twice the amount spent by the American government during all the years from 1789 to 1941. The government raised much of this money by increasing taxes. Since so many Americans were working, the earnings that could be taxed had increased tremendously. In addition, the government borrowed in excess of $100 billion by selling war bonds. The Government Sets Up Controls Another money problem that usually comes during wartime is inflation, or an increase in wages and prices. Inflation results when there is more money than there are goods to buy with the money. After America entered the war, a tremendous amount of money flooded into the Chapter 30 619 The family was listed as number 13453. They had ten days to pack before they had to report to the Civil Control Sta- tion—ten days to decide what to take, what to give away, what to sell, and what to save. Friends took the piano and boxes of books. Some furniture went into storage, and some was sold. Their old collie, Laddie, was given away. On the last morning, neighbors brought breakfast, then drove them to the Civil Control Station at the First Congregational Church. As they entered the church, the family saw armed soldiers guarding the doors. Family 13453, the Uchidas, lived in Berkeley, California. Dwight and Iku Uchida were Japanese immigrants who, because of their nationality, could not become citizens. Their daughters, Yoshiko and Keiko, were American citizens born in the United States. After the bornbing of Pearl Harbor, people feared Japanese-Americans might spy for Japan. President Roosevelt ordered the army to evacuate the entire Japanese-American community on the west coast to camps in the West and Midwest. From the camps, people were to be relocated to areas away from the west coast. Within two months, 110,000 American citizens and their alien parents lost their incomes, their property, and their civil liberties. Yoshiko Uchida was a college student when her family was sent to Topaz, Utah. Like all the camps. Topaz was isolated. The housing barracks were quickly and badly built. Summers were hot and dry, and winters were cold and snowy. Always the air was full of dust. Yoshiko worked as a secretary and a teacher until 1943, when she left for graduate school at Smith College. Her sister Kay also moved east. After the war, Yoshiko Uchida became a teacher and a writer. Several of her books are about Japanese- American life before and during the war. She writes for all Americans, she says, "with the hope that through knowledge of the past, they will never allow another group of people in America to be sent into a desert exile again." ----Yoshiko Uchida----- Member of Family Number 13453 2. Truman's Fair Deal Learn these important terms: social programs National Housing Act of 1949 discrimination communism Internal Security Act Remember the main idea: President Truman's term in office was not always smooth or successful. He failed to get Congress to approve much of his Fair Deal program. He also had to deal with charges that government officials who were serving under him were dishonest and disloyal. Look for answers to these questions: 1. Why did President Truman fail to win support for much of his Fair Deal program? 2. For which social programs was Truman able to win support? 3. What made the American people become concerned that communism was spreading inside the United States? The Congress that President Truman had to work with was not a very cooperative one. Southern Democrats refused to support and vote for any part of the Fair Deal that involved equal rights issues. They were joined by the Republicans who opposed most parts of the Fair Deal. Republicans did not want to see the government grow bigger by involving itself in new and expensive social programs. Social programs aim to assist the poor, the sick, and the needy, improving the quality of their lives. Efforts To Make the Nation Color Blind As part of his Fair Deal program. President Truman asked Congress to pass laws to enforce equal rights for all Americans. He called for a federal law that would make lynching, or hanging someone without a trial, unlawful. He also wanted a law ending discrimination in hiring practices. Many employers would not consider some people for certain jobs simply because of their ethnic background. Truman wanted all jobs to be open equally to every qualified person. Think: Life in the South was slow to change. This 1947 scene could have been from 1847. Respond Why had it become necessary to pass a federal law ending discrimination in hiring? Truman also proposed a law that would end segregation on all travel systems. Another proposed law would have stopped the use of the poll tax as a voting requirement. Congress did not pass any of these laws. Chapter 31 649 However, on his own. President Truman did much to bring about equal treatment for all Americans. He ended discrimination in hiring in the federal civil service system. Truman also ended segregation in the armed forces. Black and white Americans began to fight side by side in the army, navy, and air force. Efforts To Help the Disadvantaged President Truman was also defeated in his attempt to get federal aid for education. In addition, Congress turned down his plan for government health insurance. His proposal to repeal the Taft-Hartley law also fell through. It seemed as if the Fair Deal and Congress were constantly on a collision course. But Congress was willing to expand and improve the Social Security system. The Social Security program grew to include over ten million more Americans. Moreover, the monthly payments to American workers over sixty-five were increased. Congress also agreed to raise the minimum wage for workers. It rose from forty cents an hour to seventy-five cents an hour. Over one million workers benefited from this increase. Congress also passed the National Housing Act of 1949. This law made it possible to clear slums and to build low- cost public housing. The public housing projects built under this law helped to improve the living conditions of many poor Americans. Efforts To Encourage Immigration Between the 1920s and the 1940s, immigration to the United States had slowed to a trickle. Laws passed in the 1920s cut down the number of immigrants allowed to enter the country. During the Great Depression and World War II, immigration declined even further. However, after the war, many homeless Think: The House Un-American Activities Committee was formed to investigate Communist activities in the United States. Above. Richard Nixon and other members hold a hearing investigating suspected Communists in the film industry. Many innocent people lost their jobs. Respond Do you think these investigations were fair? Why, or why not? Europeans wished to immigrate. But Congress wanted to move slowly. Large scale immigration could lead to problems of unemployment. As a solution, in 1948, Congress passed a law allowing limited immigration. Thus, about 200,000 carefully selected Europeans were permitted to enter the United States. President Truman felt that this law did not go far enough. He thought that it favored Europeans from western Europe. Meanwhile, homeless Europeans from southern and eastern Europe were largely excluded. In 1950, Congress agreed to change the law. The new law allowed 415,000 Europeans from all parts of Europe to enter the United States. Spy Stories In the years after the war, a fear of communism began to grip many Americans. Communism is a system of government that has only one party controlling all production of goods. A Communist government controls its people by telling them where to work and by limiting what they can do. Many Americans feared a Communist takeover of America. To some degree, this fear of communism was based on fact. Following the war, the Soviet Union gained control of the governments of a number of eastern European nations. But the United States did nothing to stop it. In addition, by the early 1950s, various spy rings had been uncovered in both the United States and Canada. These spy rings had stolen secret government documents and given the information to the Soviets. Americans assumed that there were many disloyal people in the government. President Truman had to investigate the loyalty of government officials. In March 1947, he ordered a loyalty investigation of all government workers. Any employee found to be a member of a Communist organization was to be fired. By the time the investigation was completed in 1951, three million workers had been cleared. Only 212 had been fired. Those who were fired were not found guilty of spying. They merely belonged to what were thought to be suspicious organizations. Thus, the government considered them bad security risks. It seemed that Americans' fears of Communist spies in the government were exaggerated. But Joseph McCarthy, a senator from Wisconsin, continued to make unfair charges against many Americans. He claimed to have a list of Communists who worked for the American government. These charges greatly increased the public's fear of communism. As a result of these fears. Congress passed the Internal Security Act over President Truman's veto. This act required all Communist groups to file their membership lists with the government. Members were not allowed to work in defense factories, nor were they permitted to get passports. Even with this law, many Americans felt that the Truman Chapter 31 651 Air raid sirens wailed. Boat whistles blew. Storekeepers closed their doors and joined the celebration in the streets. Students cheered as the voice of their high school principal came over the school intercom. "I am delighted to announce that today, in Washington, D.C., the United States House of Representatives passed the statehood bill. This bill admits Hawaii to the United States and makes us the fiftieth state in the Union! All Hawaiians are invited to join in the celebrations, so school is dismissed for the next two days!" Many Hawaiians worked hard to change Hawaii from a territory to a state. Territory laws could be vetoed by Congress. Furthermore, Hawaiians could not vote for president or have a voting representative in Congress. For these reasons, Hawaiians wanted to govern themselves as a state. Islanders wanted to participate in local and national government. Hiram Fong was a leader in the Hawaiian movement for statehood. His parents came from China to work on the sugar plantations. There were eleven children in the Fong family, and very little money to spare. When he was four, Hiram Fong began working with his sisters and brothers, earning ten cents for every thirty pounds of beans they picked. As he grew older, Fong found other jobs. He shined shoes, sold newspapers, and worked as a delivery boy. He worked his way through college and law school. When Hiram Fong began practicing law, he had three partners: a Korean, a Japanese, and a Hawaiian. The firm mirrored the mix of backgrounds that made up Hawaiian society. Hiram Fong served in the Hawaiian Territorial legislature for many years. He was vice president of the Hawaiian Constitutional Convention, and he campaigned long and hard for statehood. After Hawaii became a state, Hiram Fong was elected Hawaii's first U.S. Senator. Thus the man whose parents had been indentured servants on a sugar plantation became the first Asian-American senator in the United States. —Hiram Fong— The Senator from Hawaii Chapter 31 657 Poverty amid Prosperity Although most Americans lived well during the 1950s, some lived in poverty. They could not afford proper food, clothing, or housing. In the 1950s, 25 million American families lived on an income of less than $4,000 per year. This meant nearly one out of every five Americans lived in poverty. Who were these people? Many below the poverty line lived in rural America. Many farm families, including Mexican- Americans who were traveling farmwork- ers, earned far less than $4,000 a year. Whether on farms or in cities, many Americans older than sixty-five also had barely enough money to live on. By far the largest number of poor people lived in cities. Puerto Ricans who had left their island for a better life settled in the big cities of the Northeast. Growing numbers of black Americans also left their homes in the South for the cities of the Northeast and the Midwest. These groups were disappointed by what they found. A pattern seemed to be emerging by the end of the 1950s. Young, well-off white families were moving to the suburbs, while poorer black families were settling into the older housing in the cities. When higher income people moved out, property values dropped. Lower property values meant less income for cities from property taxes. As a result, it became much more difficult for many cities to pay for the services they had to provide. Downtown sections began to decline. Old neighborhoods turned into slums. Schools became overcrowded, and the quality of education fell. Inner city poverty became an unofficial kind of segregation. It was a trap that was almost impossible to escape. In the rest of this chapter, you will find out what black Americans did to end segregation, overcome poverty, and try to win their share of the American dream. Think: Like many Americans, these Puerto Ricans lived in poverty in a big city. Respond: What caused the cities to change from areas of wealth to places of poverty? Section Review 1. Give an example of how a boom in one industry created a boom in others. 2. What types of workers were affected in a negative way by the coming of automation? 3. What issues caused unions to go out on strike in the 1950s? 4. Which groups of Americans did not share in the prosperity of the 1950s? Chapter 33 691 The U.S. Government in the 1960s Years 1960-1968 John F. Kennedy elected president 1960 Civil Rights Act passed Lyndon Johnson elected president 1964 Rioting in ghettos 1967 March on Washington President Kennedy assassinated Lyndon Johnson became president Voting Rights Act passed Medicare passed Immigration and Nationality Act passed Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., assassinated Robert Kennedy assassinated Richard Nixon elected president to the school when black students tried to enroll. Once again, Kennedy sent in federal marshals. Wallace was forced to step aside and allow the integration. Growing Pressure to Act Increasing violence against blacks and civil rights workers made the president realize that stronger action was necessary. On May 3, 1963, police in Birmingham, Alabama, used water hoses and police dogs against defenseless civil rights marchers. A week later, the protes- tors' office was bornbed. On June 11, President Kennedy announced that he would ask Congress for new civil rights laws. The next day, Medgar Evers, field secretary of the NAACP in Mississippi, was shot to death. The time to act had arrived. Kennedy sent to Congress a major civil rights bill that outlawed segregation in employment, in any public facilities, and in schools. In August 1963, black Americans showed their support for the bill by coming to Washington, D.C., for a demonstration. The March on Washington was a peaceful gathering of more than 200,000 Americans calling for an end to racial discrimination in America. This day-long event at the Lincoln Memorial was the largest civil rights demonstration in American history. Despite this show of support, Kennedy's civil rights bill remained stalled in Congress. The Loss of a Leader Several months later, in November 1963, the president and the vice president went to Texas to win support for their program. As the president's car made its way through the crowd-lined streets of Dallas, shots rang out. Suddenly, the president slumped forward. President Kennedy was rushed to the hospital, but it was too late. Think: America was shocked by the death of its young president. Many feared that Kennedy's dreams would die with him. Respond: What do you think was Kennedy's greatest goal? Think: Bill Mauldin created this political cartoon to express his feelings about Kennedy's death. Respond. Why do you think he chose to show Lincoln grieving for Kennedy? Chapter 34 709 ----Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.- The Voice of our Conscience News stories appeared throughout the country the day after Martin and Coretta King's home was bornbed. They told the story of a bornb being thrown onto the Kings' front porch. They told of the narrow escape of Mrs. King and her infant daughter. The stories also told about the angry crowd that gathered at the Kings' home. When Dr. King arrived, he told the crowd that his family was safe, and he urged them to remain peaceful. As usual, he stated that responding to violence with violence was not the answer. The crowd, impressed by Dr. King's commitment to nonviolence, broke up and went home. Dr. King's nonviolent means of protest were often featured in news stories of his time. Beginning with his role in the Montgomery bus boycott, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., made his belief in nonviolent resistance the foundation of a great civil rights movement. Many followed his suggestions for peaceful protests. Martin Luther King traveled all over the country to protest discrimination. He was the target of harassment and violence, but he always preached and practiced peaceful resistance to violence. As he often said, he was not an outside agitator trying to stir up trouble. He wrote, "Injus- tice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere." To people who said it wasn't a good time to demonstrate. King wrote, "For years I have heard the word 'Wait'. . . . This 'Wait' has always meant 'Never.' " Dr. King was done waiting. In 1963, the hundredth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, Martin Luther King led thousands of people on a march in Washington, D.C., in support of the civil rights bill in Congress. In 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. In 1968, his life was ended by an assassin's bullet. The peaceful man was killed by act of violence. Martin Luther King gave his life to the nonviolent movement for civil rights for all people. Today his spirit stands as a symbol of peaceful resistance to injustice of any kind, and Dr. King still has many followers. black anger and frustration showed itself in violence. Property was destroyed, homes were burned, and ghetto residents were injured and killed. In 1967, there were riots in 164 cities. In that year alone, eighty-two people died in the riots, thirty- four hundred were injured, and more than eighteen thousand were arrested. New Black Leaders Backing this fighting mood were new black leaders who encouraged blacks to cut their ties to white society. Leaders such as Malcolm X, a Black Muslim, told blacks that they had a "right to resist" being treated unjustly by whites. They said blacks should resist "by any means necessary." Still other black leaders suggested that ghetto residents carry guns to resist being mistreated by local police. These new leaders stood for violence. They thought violence would bring faster results than those gained by Martin Luther King's nonviolent methods. The civil rights movement became divided, and both sides lost strength. Supporters of nonviolence suffered their biggest loss when Dr. King was shot and killed in Memphis, Tennessee, in April 1968. King had gone to Memphis to lend support to striking garbage collectors. He was shot by James Earl Ray as he stood outside his motel room. The nation's cities exploded in violence once again as the news of King's death spread. Johnson's Successes President Johnson still had many plans in mind for achieving the Great Society. Johnson got Congress to agree to set up the Department of Transportation as a Cabinet-level department. And he also convinced Congress to pass a gun control law. This act made it unlawful to purchase a handgun outside the buyer's home state. Congress also passed a new immigration law called the Immigration and Think King and his followers often ended their meetings by joining hands and singing "We Shall Overcome." Respond Why do you suppose they chose to sing this hymn? Nationality Act. This law ended the quota system that had been in effect since the 1920s. Although the new law limited the total number of immigrants allowed to enter the United States, it permitted in people from all over the world. A Broad-minded Supreme Court The Supreme Court took a fresh look at many issues in the 1960s. As a result, it made a number of decisions that expanded the rights of the individual. In a series of cases, the Court gave its support to the civil rights laws that Congress had passed. The Court also supported cases that were trying to speed up the end of segregation in schools. And the Court ruled that Bible reading and prayers in the public schools were unlawful. In a series of cases relating to the rights of those accused of crimes, the Court made several new rulings. The Court said police had to inform accused parties of their rights upon arrest. Also, the accused had to have a lawyer present when questioned by the police. Finally, states had to provide a lawyer for anyone accused of a crime if that person could not afford to hire one. President Johnson saw that the war in Vietnam was so unpopular with the people that he might not be able to win his party's nomination. On March 31, 1968, Johnson announced that he would not be a candidate for president. Johnson's decision brought another challenger into the race, Vice President Hubert Humphrey. While McCarthy and Kennedy spoke against the president's policies, Humphrey defended them. Johnson's Decision Most Americans expected President Johnson to run for a second term in 1968. But Johnson faced some stiff challenges in the primary elections. In New Hampshire, Johnson was defeated by Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota. McCarthy was strongly opposed to the war in Vietnam, and he made his position on the war the key issue in his campaign. McCarthy's victory encouraged Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York to also try to become the Democratic candidate. Kennedy opposed the war, and he had strong support among blacks and workers. Think Johnson's vice president. Hubert Humphrey, won the Democratic nomination, but lost the election by a narrow margin. Respond: What had weakened Humphrey's chance of winning? We like to think that our government is stable. It is, after all, one of the oldest governments in the world. But during the early 1970s, Americans' confidence in their government was badly shaken. A major scandal, known as Watergate, forced Americans to take a long, hard look at their political leaders. In addition to political problems, America during the 1970s faced economic and social concerns. Americans spent more money and received fewer goods. Many had no jobs. Gasoline was scarce. Americans felt caught up in worsening economic conditions. At the same time, women and minorities made their unhappiness known. They demanded equal rights, and the government responded. Still, years of inequality could not be forgotten quickly. In this chapter you will read about many problems. But you will also read about solutions. You will see how the United States dealt with its problems and looked toward the future. You will also begin to see some long-term consequences for American actions of the 1960s and 1970s. 1. Nixon and Watergate Learn these important terms: wage and price controls Cost of Living Council Watergate scandal kickbacks Remember the main idea: Richard Nixon was forced to resign the presidency because of his involvement in the cover-up of the Watergate scandal. Look for answers to these questions: 1. What accomplishments did Richard Nixon achieve during his first term? 2. How did the Watergate scandal begin? Why did it spread? 3. Why did Richard Nixon resign from office? Richard Nixon became president at a difficult time in our nation's history. In 1968, the country was badly divided over the Vietnam War. Civil rights were a burning issue. The level of violence in America was high. News on the economic front was not encouraging. Inflation, or a general rise in the level of prices, was becoming a major problem. During his campaign, Nixon had promised to put an end to America's woes. That, however, was not an easy promise to keep. Throughout his first term, Nixon Chapter 36 747 He was hot and tired, and his back was killing him. The California air was dusty and hard to breathe. He bent over and cut another bunch of grapes. Slowly he moved down the row of vines, bending and cutting. Every time he stooped over, the ache in his back grew more painful. In the distance he heard the faint drone of an airplane. The sound grew louder as the crop duster approached. Suddenly the air was full of mist. He began to cough, and his eyes began to water. Other workers struggled for breath. The fog of DDT settled on the grapes and vines and invaded the fieldworkers' lungs. He continued working, stooping and cutting the grapes. By the end of the day he could hardly stand up straight. By the end of the day he had earned less than ten dollars. For his backbreaking fieldwork, Cesar Chavez was paid very little. Cesar Chavez began fieldwork when his family lost their farm during the depression. Pay was poor, housing was worse, and the Chavez family often lived in their car. As Mexican-Americans, they suffered much discrimination. Cesar Chavez wanted to make life better for fieldworkers. Their living and working conditions convinced him that they needed the strength and protection of a labor union. He began to organize the workers into the United Farm- workers. Farmers and growers refused to bargain with the new union, so Chavez led a strike. California growers were not interested in workers' problems. They threatened the strikers with violence. Like Martin Luther King, Cesar Chavez believed in nonviolence. He organized fasts, marches, and finally a national boycott of grapes and lettuce. The boycott was successful, and the growers signed contracts with the United Farmworkers. In 1975, California passed a law giving farmworkers the right to hold union elections and to bargain collectively with growers. Under Cesar Chavez's leadership, the National Farmworkers Union has improved wages and living conditions of farmworkers. It has given them back their dignity, as people recognize the importance and worth of those who harvest food. Cesar Chavez Leader of Farmworkers Chapter 36 755 Think: Gloria Steinem and other women marched to gain support for the Equal Rights Amendment. The ERA was meant to end all laws that discriminated against women. Respond: What were the successes and failures of the women's movement? Women's Rights One of the hottest issues in the 1970s was that of women's rights. Women made up more than 50 percent of the population. Despite being the majority, they did not enjoy the same rights as men. Most women working outside the home found themselves in low-paying, low-level jobs. Only a small number were hired as doctors, lawyers, or executives. Other jobs, such as truck driving and carpentry, were not considered appropriate for women at all. Even when women performed the same jobs as men, they often received less money. Since the 1960s, many women like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem had been working for women's rights. In the 1970s, the women's rights movement gained strength. People realized that men and women should be treated equally. The government began passing laws to ensure equality. The Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 required equal pay for equal work. And that same year. Congress approved an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the Constitution. It was designed to guarantee women equal rights under the law. This amendment failed to become law because not enough states ratified it. Thirty-eight states needed to vote for it; only thirty-five did so. Still, the campaign for the ERA helped make Americans aware of the women's rights movement. As attitudes changed, new career paths opened up to women. More women began working outside the home. Some took jobs because they or their families needed the money. Others worked because they enjoyed the challenge. By 1980, there were significant numbers of women in almost every occupation. New choices brought new problems, however. Women struggled to balance their careers with their roles as wives and mothers. Hispanics Seek Equal Rights Many Hispanics, or Spanish-speaking peoples, also began demanding better treatment. Some Hispanics had just arrived in America. Others had lived here for generations. No matter how long they had been in America, though, Hispanics often had trouble entering the mainstream of society. Their language, skin color, and culture set them apart from other Americans. This made them easy victims of discrimination. In the 1960s and 1970s, Hispanic leaders worked to improve the status of their people. They began the League of United Latin American Citizens to fight for equal rights. They formed similar groups on college campuses. At election times, Hispanics supported Hispanic candidates for public office. Native Americans Unite Native Americans also called for an end to the discrimination they had suffered for so long. Some worked toward this goal through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Others formed a more radical group called the American Indian Movement (AIM). In 1973, two hundred AIM members gathered at the village of Wounded Knee in South Dakota. This had been the site of an Indian slaughter in 1890. For two months, the AIM members occupied the town. They burned buildings and brandished guns. Such violence was unusual, though. Most Native Americans used peaceful methods to advance their cause. By the late 1970s, they had won a series of court rulings giving them more power. Think: Native Americans worked to improve their housing, medical care, education, and employment opportunities. Respond: Why do you think a Native American group placed this tepee near the White House? Think: The Gray Panthers helped change attitudes about older people. This awareness led to lower prices for senior citizens. Respond What special needs do older people have? New Minority Groups Form Encouraged, perhaps, by the success of others, new minority groups popped up. Older people formed an organization called the Gray Panthers to fight for equal rights for senior citizens. People with all types of physical handicaps formed similar groups. Consumers, too, organized special groups. They wanted more government protection of their rights. The Ecology Movement Americans became aware of their environment in the late 1960s. They suddenly became concerned about ecology. Ecology is the way living creatures relate to the environment. People realized how dangerous it was to dump pollutants into the air, water, and land. They questioned the wisdom of spraying chemicals on crops. They cringed at the litter along America's Chapter 36 759 Think: People were becoming more aware of hazardous wastes. Closely examine this contaminated truck and the man who is spraying it down. Respond: Where will the waste go? highways. And they protested the dirty fumes spewed out by automobiles. The government responded to these concerns by passing stricter pollution laws. And in 1970, Congress created the Environmental Protection Agency This agency was set up to coordinate pollution control programs. It was also designed to set tough environmental standards. Energy Versus the Environment Still, the problems of pollution did not go away. Certain lakes, for example, had already been damaged beyond repair. Also, some anti-pollution measures conflicted with America's need for energy. Modem lifestyles required the use of coal, gas, oil, and other fuels. But mining and burning these fuels polluted the environment. Nuclear energy, too, came under attack. When nuclear energy is produced, a toxic, or poisonous, waste is created. There is no quick or easy way to get rid of this toxic waste. It remains deadly for thousands of years. In 1979, another danger of nuclear energy became clear. At the Three Mile Island electric power plant in Middle- town, Pennsylvania, a small pump broke down. It threatened to unleash 600,000 gallons of deadly radioactive gas. Luckily, disaster was prevented, but nuclear energy suddenly seemed riskier than ever. Certainly nuclear energy threatened the environment, but to stop using it would cut down the country's energy supply. Were people willing to lose a major source of energy for the sake of the environment? Some were, and some were not. And so the debate about nuclear energy, and other forms of pollution-producing energy, continued. The End of the 1970s Americans saw great changes at home during the 1970s. Public confidence in national leaders was badly shaken by the Watergate scandal. The economy was in bad shape. Inequality still hurt many Americans. Yet, the nation managed to survive. Ford and Carter worked hard to restore the people's faith in their government. They tried, although unsuccessfully, to solve the country's economic problems. And they addressed the demands made by women and minorities for greater rights. As Americans headed into the 1980s, these and other issues at home continued to pose great challenges. As you read the next chapter, you will learn about the challenges the United States faced abroad during the 1970s. Section Review 1. What was the Equal Rights Amendment? Why didn't it become law? 2. What happened at Wounded Knee in 1973? 3. What dangers does nuclear energy pose to the environment? 4. Why haven't pollution-producing energy sources been abandoned? Chapter 36 761 Think President Carter was dedicated to human rights around the world. He spoke out strongly against the Soviet Union's refusal to allow mistreated Jews to leave the country. Above, Israelis are shown demonstrating against Soviet treatment of Jews. Respond What were the good and bad points of Carter's goals? Foreign Policy Under Carter and Ford When Gerald Ford took over as president on August 9, 1974, he did not alter Nixon's foreign policy. Instead, he picked up where Nixon left off. Ford continued the policy of detente. He also pursued closer ties with Communist China. U.S. policies did change, however, when Jimmy Carter took office in 1977. Carter had his own ideas about foreign policy. He strongly believed in human rights. That is, he thought all people should be free to speak and live as they pleased. They should not have to fear bad treatment by their own government. U.S.—Soviet Relations Turn Sour Carter's ideas led to increased tensions with the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, people were not allowed to criticize the government. Those who did were called dissidents and were promptly silenced. Some were sent to labor camps. Others were sent to Siberia, a cold and remote corner of the Soviet Union. Carter condemned the Soviets for their actions. He also condemned them for their discrimination against Jews. Soviet Jews, for example, were not allowed to travel freely. Carter's position angered the Soviets. They accused him of poisoning relations between the two countries. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded its neighbor, Afghanistan. Carter felt the Soviet invasion was a violation of the rights of the people of Afghanistan. In protest. Carter ordered American athletes to boycott the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. The spirit of detente was dead. Chapter 37 773 IMow you are ready to cover some history that you might remember from your own lifetime. That, however, may not make it easier to understand. Things are happening very fast. Sometimes it seems there is no time to stop and sort out what has just happened before the next wave of events arrives. For example, you probably have not had time to consider what effect the 1980s will have on the future. Before you can think about that question, you will need to take a closer look at exactly what happened during those years. In this chapter you will read about President Ronald Reagan's economic policies and how they affected inflation and federal deficits. You will see how Reagan tried to control communism and how he dealt with the threat of nuclear war. You will also read about challenges brought on by immigration, technology, energy needs, and the environment. These challenges are certain to have a powerful impact on your life. 1. The Reagan Years—Domestic Issues and Events Learn these important terms: supply-side economics budget deficits Gramm- Rudman Bill trade deficit Remember the main idea: Although Ronald Reagan faced his share of problems, he proved to be a very popular president. America's economic issues received a great deal of his attention. Look for answers to these questions: 1. What made Ronald Reagan such a popular president? 2. How did growing budget deficits affect the nation? 3. What issues became problems for President Reagan during his second term? In 1980, the American voters chose not to reelect Jimmy Carter. The Carter years had been marred by problems both in the economy and in foreign relations. Carter's honest, down-to-earth image no longer seemed that appealing. People wanted a president who would inspire confidence. They were finally ready to put the defeat in Vietnam and the shame of Watergate behind them. They wanted someone who would make them feel good about their country again. The man they chose was Ronald Reagan. Chapter 38 785 When actor Ronald Reagan (1911— ) joined the Republicans in 1962. they were delighted. He had the image they needed. His popularity eased him into the presidency in 1982. To end the deficits. Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman Bill in 1986. It called for a balanced budget in five years. It also ordered the government to meet targets for deficit reduction each year until the year 1991. Reagan also had to cope with the economic collapse of thousands of America's farms. American farmers were having trouble selling their crops to other countries. This was due, in large part, to the fact that other countries were producing more of their own grain than ever before. American farmers were also hurt by falling land values and depressed prices. Finally, many farmers were hurt by a drought that struck the Southeast in the summer of 1986. In the wake of these troubles, some Americans thought the government should increase its aid to farmers. Others thought the government was already doing too much. Finding an effective farm policy remained one of the most difficult problems facing American leaders. Think Five years before he retired. Chief Justice Burger welcomed Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court. Respond: What other new opportunities became available to women? Think Protesting in Washington. D.C.. farmers wanted the government to support them by maintaining farm prices. Respond: What problems caused farm prices to drop? Women and Minorities By the mid-1980s, more and more women and minorities were gaining positions of power. In 1981, for example, Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female Supreme Court justice. In 1983, Sally Ride became the first American woman in space. And in 1984, Jesse Jackson, a black minister, ran for president. Still, equality was a long way off. The Equal Rights Amendment was defeated in 1982. Women continued to earn much less than men who performed similar In 1971, Jesse Louis Jackson (1941— ) founded Operation PUSH to promote blacks in business. Twelve years later, he announced his candidacy for the nation's highest office. named to the Supreme Court. With these two appointments, Reagan ensured that the nation's highest court would maintain the conservative outlook it had developed under Burger. Changes in Congress On the other hand. Congress took on a different look with the elections of 1986. The Democrats took control of the Senate. That victory gave them a majority in both houses of Congress. When the new Congress convened in January 1987, it was the one hundredth Congress since the founding of the Republic. This Democratic Congress posed challenges to President Reagan, both on domestic legislation and on the conduct of foreign policy. jobs. Unemployment rates remained higher among minorities than among whites. And cuts in social welfare programs made life much harder for many minorities and single mothers. Changes on the Supreme Court In the summer of 1986, Chief Justice Warren Burger announced his retirement. Reagan named Justice William Rehnquist as the new Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He then named Antonin Scalia to fill Rehnquist's old spot on the bench. Scalia was the first Italian-American to be Section Review 1. How did Reagan's approach to domestic problems differ from the Democrats' approach? 2. What was Reagan's supply-side economics? 3. How did Mondale try to attract voters in the 1984 election? Did his attempt work? 4. What problems did Reagan face during his second term? Think The Burger Court emphasized the rights of society over those of the individual. Upon Burger's retirement, Reagan appointed Rehnquist as Chief Justice. Reagan wanted the Rehnquist Court (pictured below) to continue making conservative rulings. Respond. Which do you think are more important, the rights of society or the rights of the individual? Why? Think Reagan and Gorbachev met in Iceland in an attempt to bring about an arms control agreement. Respond: What were the results of the meeting, and why? fell apart, however, when Gorbachev insisted the United States stop work on Star Wars. Several months later, in February 1987, Gorbachev made new offers on limiting intermediate range missiles. Both sides continued to wrestle with the issue of arms control. An Overview Although American prestige was compromised by the Iran-Nicaragua scandal, Reagan's anticommunist policy seemed to work. He could say that during his years in the White House he had prevented the spread of communism on many fronts. He believed that his tough attitude toward the Soviets would make the world a safer place. However, not everyone agreed with him. How to prevent nuclear war remained a crucial issue of American foreign policy. Section Review 1. How did the shooting down of Korean Airlines Flight 007 affect U.S.-Soviet relations? 2. Why did Reagan send Marines to Lebanon? 3. What was the Iran—Nicaragua connection? 4. What was the purpose of the Star Wars plan? 3. Looking Ahead Learn these important terms: acid rain Chernobyl Remember the main idea: The 1980s brought many challenges in the areas of technology and international relations. These challenges continue into the future. Look for answers to these questions: 1. What challenges did immigration pose for America in the 1980s? 2. What improvements in daily life did technology make? What problems did it bring? 3. How do the problems of one country affect other countries? Some of the challenges America faced in the 1980s had been around for years. Others were the result of the changing times. One challenge was the flood of newcomers pouring into the country. America has always attracted people longing for freedom and opportunity. Throughout its history, America has taken in immigrants from around the world. In the 1980s, the challenge came from absorbing new immigrants. New Americans In the past, most immigrants to the United States came from Europe. The new immigrants of the 1980s came from Southeast Asia and Latin America. After the Vietnam War, many refugees from South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos came to this country to escape the Communists. Once here, they had to begin a whole new way of life. They had to adjust to a totally new set of customs and learn a new language. The presence of these people forced other Americans to look at their prejudices toward Asians. It also proved a painful reminder of America's failure in the Vietnam War. Other new immigrants came from Mexico and the countries of Central America. Some came to escape from poverty. Some came to escape from harsh governments. Most were willing to do any job and to work for very low wages. To them, anything looked better than returning home. Think Immigrant workers from Mexico and Centra] America wore willing to do any job for low pay. Respond What groups in the past were forced to work in the fields for low pay? Some of these people were so desperate that they came to America illegally. By 1985, there were an estimated seven million illegal immigrants living in the United States. Each year about half a million more entered the country. Like the Southeast Asian immigrants, Hispanic immigrants had to learn to get along in a new culture with a new language. But the problems they faced were matched by problems they caused for the United States. It was impossible to have open borders. Yet it also seemed impossible to stem the tide of newcomers. The large number of illegal immigrants willing to work for low pay was driving down the level of wages in parts of America. Millions of people who did not speak English created a language problem. And slow acceptance of the newcomers by the native born led to tensions within communities. In October 1986, Congress passed a new immigration law. It allowed certain illegal immigrants to become United States citizens. Those who came to America before January 1, 1982, could apply for citizenship. The law also punished employers who knowingly hired illegal immigrants. It did not appear, however, that this new law would end the problem of future illegal immigrants. The Age of the Computer The 1980s brought amazing new advances in the field of technology. Computers had existed for years, but it was during the 1980s that "the Age of the Computer" really arrived. Computers were installed in banks, offices, schools, airports, libraries, and private homes. Computers changed the ways people worked, shopped, studied, and played. They also made possible many advances in science and medicine. So powerful was the impact of the computer that, in 1982, Chapter 38 797 Think: The America's Cup races of the 1980s showed that Americans can face defeat and glory with dignity. In 1984, Dennis Conner lost the Cup to the Australians, who had a technologically advanced boat. Then, in 1987. Conner and the crew of the Stars and Stripes made a remarkable comeback, beating the Australians 4—0. Respond: What lessons can be learned from the American loss and victory in this event? Toward the Future Increasingly, the problems of one country affect other nations. Immigration is changing the distribution of the world's population. Progress in technology is requiring cooperation among countries. Energy and environmental issues are affecting everyone, as shown by acid rain and the Chernobyl accident. Countries need to work together to share information and solve problems. And everyone has to work together to prevent nuclear war. Achieving a level of cooperation remains the biggest challenge of the future. Section Review 1. How did computers change people's lives? 2. How have American businesses dealt with competition from the Japanese? 3. What happened at Chernobyl? 4. In what ways do modem problems in one country affect other nations? Chapter 38 801
