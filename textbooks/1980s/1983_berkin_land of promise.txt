(See map. page 6.) During several periods In the Ice Age. when the sea level was lower. Il probably was a land bridge. Columbus called the native Americans 'Indiana." because he thought he was In the East Indies. The name stuck, and although other terms, such as "First Americans" and "Native Ammcans." are sometimes used, the name "Indian" is the one most commonly used to describe these varied people* And of course then? were the Vikings! These Scandinavian sailors, among the lines! ship builders and the fiercest raiders of their day. plundered the coasts of F.urope during the 9th. IOth. and 11th centuries. At least one small group led by Feif trie son landed on the coast of North America in the year 1000. But. except for a few Mattered contacts with Indians, the Vikings made no impression on the land or people. They merely touched the shore briefly, then sailed away. Their deeds, except in Norse song and legend, were quickly forgotten Early European Explorers of the Americas Columbus was soon followed by other explorers, just as brave, just as eager. In 1513. the Spanish explorer Vasco Nunez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and became the first European to view the Pacific Ocean. The same year, Juan tone* de LeOn. also from Spain, discovered what he thought was a large Island in the Caribbean- it turned out to be the coast of Florida. Ponce de LeOo was the first European to explore land that s bow part ot the continental United States. Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese sailing for Spam, set out in 1519 to determine the size of the Pacific Ocean. Though he was killed in the Phil ipptoes, 18 survivors of his expedition circumnavigated the world In 1521, Elemando Cones conquered the Aztec empire in Mexico, and in 1532. Francisco Pizarro destroyed the Inca empire in South America. These conquistadors military leaders, conquerors) seized vast quantities of gold and silver, touching off a feverish search for other golden lands England and France also sent out explorers to had riches. In fact, the very first voyage to North America was made in 1497 by the English explorer John Cabot, an Italian by birth. He sailed along the coasts of Nova Scotia and New England, leering a water route to Japan. In 1534. a French explorer, Jacques Cartier, sought this water route to Asia, but discovered instead the St. Lawrence River rhe voyages of Cabot and Cartier paved the way for English and French claims in the following century.

By the 1890s there were four mart- lines extending from the Midwest to the- Pacific Coast: the Southern Pacific ; the Northern Pacif k. the Great Northern, and the Atchison. Topeka 8c Santa Fc These- major routes, or trunk lines, were not the only railroads butll in the period. Hundreds of feeder lines connecting local towns and cities to the trunk lines, were also constructed. Land grants from state and federal govern merits helped in the building of all these lines except the Great Northern. The railroads didn't use these land grants just to build track and stations. Instead, they sold the land to settlers and businesses. In this way. the railroads helped to populate the West. They made their land especial ly attractive to customers, often by offering low faxes to people interested in purchasing western property. Some rail companies sent salesmen as far as Europe, equipped with elaborately illustrated brochures to convince people to emigrate to the Amerkan West. In one case, the Atchison. i. MASS PRODUCTION In 1892 there were 4.000 millionaire* living in the United State*. Almost all of them were "new tycoon*" who had made their fortunes in the business world of the late 19th century.

TV New World of .Mass Production IW kind of work style was no longer characteristic of American life after the rise of the railroads. Now-in 1880— instead of a shop, you go to a Drwhr built factory filled with noise and crowded with hundreds of workers. You no longer make a pair of shoes from start to finish In this new world, you perform one small task over and over and over. You receive a partially completed shoe from one worker, add your part to its construction, and pass It on to the next worker. This division of labor often requires you to tend a machine. You no longer determine the time it will take for you to do your job. for the machine forces you to do your job at a specific speed. Usually, your monotonous and limited tasks must be performed at a furious pace. Ilii* drastic change in tile pattern of work, called mass production, was the basis for the mushrooming of manufacture during the late 19th century. This pattern could first be seen in the textile mills of New England before the Civil War. It was unique to them in 1850: by the 1880s, it was common to all industry. In every industry, production processes became standardized, and every part became identical and interchangeable with other parts The worker was not permitted to use his or her own judgment or to make decisions because each function was planned ahead of time The way a person worked depended on the parts used and the speed of ll"e machine Factory supervisors now made dec isions that the individual artisan had once made The supervisors were themselves only a part of the process and had to answer to the owners regularly. Work in the new factory was often tiring, and the hours were long. Men. women, and even very young children frequently started work before the sun rose and finished well after it had set A work day could last 10 to 15 hours, even longer A work week did nol mean the five days we think of today, but six and sometimes seven days. Working conditions were often dangerous, for there were no safeguards on the machines and no compensation for accidents or deaths on the job. Wages averaged about SI 50 a day Luckily, the cost of living during the period dropped so that workers found they could buy more with their limited wages a* time went by. However, a person could not count on a steady Income. The boom-and-bust nature of the economy often threw' millions of people out of work The depressions of 1873 and 1893 hit working people especially bard. Many spent years looking for work, or only found temporary jobs. Shoemakers and other skilled workers lost their respected positions in society as their crafts were "i replaced by machine*. Craftsmen and women could no longer deal with their employer* on an equal hast* because their skills were no longer in demand At the same time, a new generation of unskilled workers entered the work force Eventually, as you will see. both skilled and unskilled workers banded together to demand better working conditions and wages ♦ 3K The New Immigration Mass production demanded unskilled worker*, and the need lor them increased as business expanded. Most native-born Americans still Used on fanns, however American industry solved Its labor problem by recruiting a new work force of landless immigrants Between 1877 and 1890, more than 6.3 million people came to the United States, from 1878. when 138,000 immigrants arrived, the flow increased steadily. By 1892, 789,000 men. women, and children reached our shores each year.

The bosses :uved the game for a single end: to further their pmonal ambitions. The Republican party was divided into two ■ werful factions, the Stalwarts and the Half l.-eds The Stalwarts were controlled by Senator laeae Conklins, an elegant, wealthy gmtlrman fewa New York. Conkhng was once described as j great fighter, inspired more by his hates than to love* The man Conkling hated most was not I Democrat, but a fellow Republican. Senator James G. Blaine of Maine Blaine, who led the Half-Breed* was one of the most popular politic al figures of his generation. Although the Half- Breeds claimed to support political reform, the real difference between the two factions was not the party platform. It was the struggle between Blaine and Conkling for leadership of the party A third faction, the Independent Republican* rejected lx"th of these political bosses, but they had little influence in the party. Senators like Blaine and Conkling dominated Gilded Age politics. Because of their intmse rivalry, however, they had difficulty winning nu jorities for their favorites at party conventions. Even when a boss himself managed to get the presidential nomination, the rival faction would often fail to support him in the general election, giving victory to the Democratic candidate. As a result, a "compromise candidate" was often nominated This nominee was usually a man the voters had never heard of or knew little about For example, Rutherford B. Hayes was called the "Great Unknown" when he ran for office in 1876. Other such compromise candidates were James A Garfield and Benjamin Harrison. Once in office these compromise candidates were usually honest but weak Presidents They could not break the power of the "Millionaires Club Corruption Becomes a Way of Life in Government Why did people enter politics in the Gilded Age? One of the major reasons was to become wealthy. Politics became a type of "business." Mitkral office could mean a giant step up the social ladder, bringing money, power, and the flattering attention of social and business leaders Businesses, corporations, and individuals offered handsome rewards to officeholders who voted their way. As one senator is reported to have explained the formula to a group of businessmen: You send us to Congress We pass laws under the operation ofwhich you make money, . . and out of your profits you further contribute to our campaign fund, to send us back again, to pas* more law* to enable you to make mote money This kind of bribery was commonplacr. and both parties profited from It Between 1866 and 1872. fur instance, the Union Pacific Railroad spent about $400,000 on bribes to politicians in FROn THE flKCMNES The Gilded Age TU Tsred Kin* "f New York City He 'buHam of politic* ' descended down the bddrr of government to state and city politics.

What was one of the main reasons people entered politics in the Glided Age7 Give one example each of corruption in the executive branch, the Congress, and in city government. Who were the reformers who backed the reform of the civil service? They tended to be educated and wealthy Republic<mv members of the old American elite before the rise of the "new ty- coons." Twice during the Gilded Age the members of this Independent faction had bolted the Republican party: in 1872. in opposition to Grant's re-election, and again in 1884. when the party chose Half Breed boss James G Blaine for the presidency. Blaine represented everything these reformers hated, for he had risen to power on the back of the spoils system. ♦*!> In 1884, therefore, the reformers marched out of the Republican convention hall. They announced that they would support any decent can didatr that the Democrats might nominate. Newspapers labeled these Republican reformers "Mugwumps."* but the Republican party called them traitors The leaders of the Mugwumps were distinguished men like Carl Schorr, the former Secretary- of the Interior. K L. Godkin. the editor of the Satton magazine, and Charles Francis Adams, son of John Quincy Adams and father of the Henry Adams quoted earlier. The Democrats, seeing their chance to capture the- White House for the first time since Buchanan won in 1856. nominated a reform governor of New York. Grover Cleveland. IVue to their pledge, the Mugwumps threw thru support behind the Democratic nominee. Cleveland had a reputation as a strong and honest administrator who had shown the courage to defy Tammany Hall by insisting on reform during his term as governor The Ejection of 1881 The 1884 campaign became particularly bitter and loud Each candidate's past was raked over for fraud, flaws, and major or minor mistakes Cleveland's Illegitimate child was a campaign issue.

Their radical views and the fact that many American labor union members were becoming attracted to this "foreign doctrine" made them guilty in the eyes of many Americans even before the trial.

The Homestead and Pullman Strikes The decline of the Knights of 1-alior did not mean an end to labor-management violence. In fact, two of the biggest and bloodiest strikes took place in the 1890s. The first was the Homestead strike, which occurred in 1892 at Andrew Carnegie's Homestead steelworks near Pittsburgh. The chairman of the steel company. Henry Clay Frick, cut wages that year. He also demanded that workers at Homestead disband their union, the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steelworkers. The workers refused.

By that time, there were 14 American cities with more than 200.000 people. (See map. page 96.) Still, the definition of sire kept changing By 1900. there were six American cities with more than 500.000 people Three—Chicago. Philadelphia, and New York—had well over a million people living within their borders. Chicago had 1.7 million; Philadelphia had 1.3 million; and New York had a mind boggling 3 4 million! Thu growth of cities, or urbaniiation did not take place at an even pace across the United States. If you looked at a mnp of the country, say tn 1890, you would see dots across the United States representing cities Most of those dots would be densely packed In the North Atlantic and Midwestern states. Few dots would be located in the South or West The vast majority of city- dwellers lived in Illinois. Ohio. Pennsylvania. New York and Massachusetts, for these tended to be the most industrialized stair*. Cities and factories grew together. During the 19th century, the population of the country Increased over 12 times. But. in the same period of time, the population in cities increased over 87 times. If you look that 1890 map of cities and changed it tn a population distribution map like the one on page 96. which shows how many people lived in one area in 1890, you would see the same clustering of dots In the North Atlantic and Midwestern states. America was becoming an urban nation. As the chart on the facing page shows, by 1900 two-fifths of all Americans lived in urban areas. People were leaving the countryside and moving to the cities, where they hoped to find jobs and opportunities that rural life did not offer Most of the 'new Immigrants" also came from rural areas in southern and eastern Europe and Asia The late 19th century saw millions of people, native-born and foreign born, change from country "folk" to city "slickers." It Is hard to imagine such vast change in " short a time And this rapid pace of urban growth brought new problems to American life, special problems tied to a new urban age. The cities grew so fast and filled up so quickly that the services city dwellers needed could not keep up with the demand City dwellers needed efficient transportation to get to and from work, a water supply fa drinking and washing, garbage disposal and sewage system* to take away wastes, decent bousing, and protection from fire and crime In the late 19th century, the cities' problems centered around these basic needs. The Rise of "Streetcar Cities" The growth of the city presented spec tal problems for urban transportation. In the early 19th century, most urban areas had been walking cities ' This meant that the city was small enough to permit people to walk wherever they had to go But. with the expansion of the city—and with A'f.i tear Total PnpululKMi < million.) 1870 40 1890 63 1900 76 Kt HAL AND I KHAN H<#*11 -ATKIN.

But these crowded whi ch* were slow and noisy, and horses could only pul.I a limited passenger load The streetcars earned pollution, too. Today we complain of smug m oar cities, but horse droppings polluted the IStIKentury urban environment with smells, flic*, and disease. By the late 19th century, cities had progressed to dec trie streetcars. The first electric streetcar tyttem was set up In Richmond. Virginia, in ISS* By 1895. more than 800 cities had electric railway lines, and the cities expanded outward along the railway lines. Thus began the era of the ftmtear cities." The streetcars ran on tracks and were attached to fire trie wires strung above the street or. some- uaes. to moving cables below the street The electric cars were much larger and faster, and coold go greater distances than the old borso- drawn vehicles But they also led to fatal acci dents in the crowded streets and contributed to terrible traffic jams. New York and Chicago experimented with elevated railways set up on platforms above the streets. At first these trains were powered by steam engines that left billowing clouds of smoke and dangerous sparks In their wake. Soon, people were arguing that the only e Hit lent transporta non system would be an underground one. In 1897. Boston opened the first subway, and seven years later New York City had one too Clean Water and Sewage Disposal Most cities lac ked the facilities to supply water to millions of people. The streets of New York. Philadelphia, and other cities smelled of the raw sewage that stood in open gutters and exposed cesspools Nearby rivers became undrinkable sewage canals. Urban drinking water tasted terrible, for it was filled with an assortment of chemicals to kill the mounting germs and mask the pollutants. *5 Toward the end of the century, ciucs did begin to set up procedures for water inspection and purification, and sewage disposal systems were constructed underneath the streets But water and waste were constant problems in the late 19th century and remained serious threats to public health.

The homes of rich and poor alike could vanish in a great blaze. After the Chicago Fire, cities developed building code* to require more fireproof construction. ai"d professional fire departments replaced the volunteer brigades. Social Reform in the City A* you saw in the last chapter, the doctrine of laissez-faire worked against federal legislation to combat urban problems Local governments did act. however. They passed fire and sanitary inspection laws, nnd even some laws regulating working conditions. For example, an 1882 New York law forbade the manufacture of cigars in apartment "sweatshops ." But these laws were olicn weak and poorly enforced. Landlords and business owners easily sidestepped them, or had them repealed. Belief in the doctrine of laisse/ faire led courts to narrowly interpret the powers of the ciues and the states. Thus the courts limit ed the- local governments' powers to Interfere with the rights of landlords and business owners Individuals and private groups worked to help the urban poor throughout the 19th century. Many of these charitable groups were wealthy tants who tended to blame the poor for thnr plight. They viewed poverty as the result of moral defect in the |ioor. Their organ> opened missions in slum areas to help the serving" poor. Although many of these charitable lions helped people, some of the mis tried hard to change the customs and even Ac religions of the poor, and worked to convert (.tfhj oiic nnd Jewish poor and their children to tantism. The response of the poor was often tile. They tamed to the urban political maci for help instead of to the missions. After all. machine would perform services witheut manding anything but their votes. The Settlement House Movement In the late 1880s a new approach to urban appeared. This was the settlement house mow ment The settlement house was a coir center within the city slums Its workers performed needed services for the neighborhood and tried to create a sense of community. Settkssssj house workers also worked hard to teach tnu" grants to deal with the mysterious wars of Amert can life. The settlement workers tended to be yoimg and middle-class They lived in the settlement house and took an active part in the dally life of the neighborhood Unlike the earlier charity groups these workers hoped to leam from their expert cnees with the poor. They were dissatisfied wsth their narrow lives as the children of a comfortable middle class The settlement worker* be Ucved that engaging in "real life" would help them grow Intellectually and morally. Many of tlicsc young settlement workrrs were j women, fresh from college. The settlement houtr [ offered these graduates a rare opportunity for active and important service to society. Their | work gave them a feeling of self- fulfillment The settlement house movement spread rapidly through America's cities. The most famous settle ment houses were Chicago's Hull House, set up by Jane Addam* in 1889: Boston's South End House, foimded by Robert A. Woods in 1892; and New York's Henry Street Settlement Hoove founded by Lillian Wald in 1893 These settlement houses focused on the practical problems facing poor city residents. They held feral government jobs be segregated from one txeber. This was the first time such segregation ud existed since Reconstruction!

The ACLU challenged the constrtu- aaahty of all gov ernment law s that It felt violat- : -t Bill of Rights. Second, many Americans ft* suspicious of Attorney General Palmer's wives. Was there a real threat to American security, or was Palmer engaging in political showmanship? Palmer's downfall came when he announced that a massive communist demonstration would take place in Nov York Ciry on May 1, 1920 Thousands of police and federal agents gathered to defend the city. When nothing happened, Americans withdrew their support of Palmer and his tactics. The Sacco-Yanzctti Case Just as Attorney General Palmer was losing his public support, attention became focused on two laborers whose conviction turned into a world wide cause ctlebre the Sacco-Ysnzrtti case. Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Van/etti were Italian immigrants Both were anarchists; they believed that government was an unnecessary evil that should be abolished. In April 1920, five armed men in a car robbed a shoe company in South Braintree. Massachusetts. The paymaster and a guard were shot and killed In May, the police arrested Sacco and Vanzrtti. They were linked with the robbery car. carried pistols, and made false statements upon their arrest. However, neither had a criminal record, and none of the stolen money showed up in their possession. In 1921. they were both found guilty of murder. The truth in the case has never been determined. (A 1961 ballistics test indicated that the gun found on Sacco was used to murder the guard.; Defenders of Sacco and Vanzetti charged that the evidence was flimsy and that ihev were really convicted for their political views, not for robbery and murder Despite appeals, the verdict of the lower court was upheld, and in 1927 Sacco and Vanzetti were executed. Mass demonstrations to prevent their execution were held by Sacco-Vanzetti defense committees in the United States. Europe, and Latin America. After their deaths, they were viewed by many people as symbols of the poor, the foreign- born, and the politically radical. Their persecution, said their defenders, was an attempt to silence opposition to conservative politics and to discourage independent thinking. Immigration Is Restricted Just as unionism and communism were linked in the public mind in 1919. so were "Americanism" 1*7 and national origin Most industrial workers were Immigrants or the children of immigrants, and many were In the fqrrfront of the imion movement. And many radicals were also immigrants. This Increased the call by some Americans for immigration restrictions. Anti-immigrant feelings may have been an Inevitable product of the war A* sou'll recall from Chapter 9. to arouse patriotism, the President had established agencies such as the Committee on Public Information I his committee churned out reels of film and millions of pamphlets Most had a strong anti-German message. When peace came, it was hard for Americans to abandon the anii-Gcnmm and other anti- foreign feelings created or fueled by the Committee. A general suspicion of foreigners and a fear of foreign ideas lingered and even increased. Perhaps even more Important, however, was the knowledge that millions of European* were planning to Immigrate to America to lind refuge from starvation and revolution. Thus. America abandoned its role as a haven for the oppressed people of Europe, just as more people than ever wanted to come to our shores In May 1921. the Emergency Quota Act was passed The law limited immigration to quotas based on the ethnic population of the United States in 1910. For example, Irish immigration after 1921 was limited to 3'i of the number of Irish Aineri cans in 1910 In 1924. the National Origins Act reduced each quota to 2% and changed the "base year" to 1890. As you know, most immigrants to America before the 1890s were from the British Isles and northwestern Europe. Thus the 1924 law admitted 140.000 immigrants from these countries each year, but let in only 21.000 per year from southern and eastern Europe. Special laws excluded Japanese. Chinese, and other Asian immigrants. The idea of an American "melting pot' no longer seemed a good one to postwar America. Elowever, the 1924 law did not restrict immigration from Mexico. Canada and other countries of the Western Hemisphere. The Rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan In the atmosphere of fear and intolerance follow lng World War I, the Ku Klux Klan. revived in 1915. gained membership rapidh. By 1924. the Klan had about 5 million members. The Klan. born In the troubled days of Reconstruction, once again raised the banner of racism and white supremacy. The new Klan may have seemed just hit old one. with the same secret rituals.

Attempting to "pure America." the new Klan spread Its through terror and violence, often beating lating. and sometimes murdering it* viennw As the Klan grew In the 1920s, Its pol power grew. too. At one point, five U.S. tel and four governors were members The KKK strong enough to prevent the major panics publicly opposing it. By 1925. the Klan was dent enough to march In the nation's capital August 8. 1925. some 50.000 hooded marched down Pennsylvania Avenue. The parade took threc-and-a-half hours The prejudice and violence of the Klan did destroy it Instead, the hypocrisy and greed al leaders caused its downfall. Men vied for of the organization. Millions of dollars in bership dues were pocketed by the le. Finally, in 1925. at the height of Its popularity scandal rocked the Klan. A prominent Klan was convicted for assaulting and lulling a woman. Many Klan members timed away their organization in disgust. The moral they believed they were protecting was not spected by their ow n leaders By 1930. its m bership had declined to about 9.000. ♦ !•* Women Win the Vote Although the spirit of reform was declining a America after the First World War. reform dd triumph in one area.

The differences in style between Hoover and Smith were clearly evident to millions of Americans, for their campaign was the first to be broadcast on the radio Smith's casual, castside voice contrasted sharply with Hoover's clipped and statesmanlike speech As expected. Hoover scored an overwhelming victory, carrying 444 electoral votes to Smith s 87. The Republicans even won the southern vote from the Democrats, their first such success since Reconstruction.

Smith represented the immigrant, the political machine. Catholicism, and all the elements of city life that many rural Americans thought were destroying America. Unfortunately, Smith's rell glon and his city orientation became the issue, bringing the intolerance of the era into the campaign What was left of the Ku Klux Klan came out in force against Smith. Droves of Democrats crossed over to the Republican party, calling themselves "Hoovercrats." If Smith became President, ran the hysterical cry. the Pope would run America. The differences In style between Hoover and Smith were clearly evident to millions of Amen cans, for their campaign was the first to be broad cast on the radio. Smith's casual, eastside voice contrasted sharply with Hoover's clipped and statesmanlike speech As expected. Hoover scored an overwhelming victory, carrying 444 electoral votes to Smith's 87. The Republicans even won the southern vote from the Democrats, their first such success since Reconstruction To a great extent, the Republicans won because Americans were happv with the prosperity and wealth of the period.

Give two reasons why Herbert Hoover won an overwhelming victory in the 1928 election In what way did the election reveal intolerance? The fierce emotions that rose to the surface in the 1928 Hoover Smith campaign were also apparent in the great debate over alcohol in the 1920s. No other issue drew the lines so sharply between rural America and the cities, between immigrant cultures and the older. Protestant society. As you know, the battle against liquor was an old one. dating back to 1820 and the founding of the American Temperance Society. By the 20th century. many reformers saw the saloon as a meeting place for machine politicians and immigrant voter* They hoped that if they could get rid of alcohol, it would be easier to get rid of corrupt politics. The Anti-Saloon la-ague, formed In 1895, had long worked for a national prohibition amend ment. When World War I came, many who were against drinking and against immigrants used the argument that brewer* were German. Ger mans were the enemy, and therefore alcohol was an evil Arguments such as these helped the lHth Amendment pass Congress in 1917. The amendment was ratified in January 1919 and became law in January of 1920. Specifically, the 18th Amendment forbade the manufacture, sale, or transportation of alcoholic beverages The Volstead Art became the law which was used to enforce the 18th Amendment It defined any liquor containing 1/2 of 1% of alcohol as Intoxicating and therefore illegal. The power to enforce the Volstead Act and treat as criminals anybody who manufactured, sold, or drank alcohol was given to the Bureau of Internal Rev enue The nation was launched on a crusade against drink, a "noble experiment" to impose morality on people, whether they wanted it or not. The "noble experiment." as Herbert Hoover called prohibition, lasted over ten wars, until 1933. when U was abandoned. During this dry decade, alcohol consumption declined, and. with it, the number of deaths due to alcoholism. Arrests for drunkenness also decreased But many people considered the total ban on drinking- including beer and wine—to be a violation of their personal liberties. Almost as soon as the Volstead Act bee* many Americans became lawbreakers. The I legal comer saloons were replaced by groimd "speakeasies." secret clubs the iocs] [ usually knew about but ignored.

Massachusetts, 1864 The factor* and machine production quickly changed the **ay people worked in the second half of the 19th century. Within a few tears, work procedures that were centuries old were outdated This was especially true In the shoe industry, which centered on Lynn, Massachusetts In this selection. Fincher's Trades' Hr Jinn-. a skilled workers' newspaper published in Philadelphia, comments on changes in shoe manufacturing in Lynn ♦ Comparatively few people are aware of the quiet, steady revolution that is going on in the business of shoemaktng. and particularly in Lynn. Previous to the Introduction of the original setving machines, which are now universally used for the binding and stitching of the uppers, little or no improvement or even change had been made in the manufacture of shoes. . . . It Is scarcely ten years since the first introduction of machinery of any kind into the manufacture of shoes in this city. Everything was done by hand, even to the cutting out of the soles, which was a slow process, and required the expenditure of a large amount of physical force. The introduction of sole cutting and stripping machines, although used sparingly. w-a$ the first indication that a change was to take place in the business of shoemaking. But no one. even ten years ago. would have dared to prophesy that the change wras to be so Immediate and so great. The rapid progress that has been made during that time, and especially -within the past year or tnx>, in the introduction of machinery in shoemaking, has been beyond all previous calculation. It may almost be said that handwork has already become the exception, and machinery the rule. The little shoemaker's shop and the shoemakers bench are passing rapidly away, soon to be known no more among us; and the immense factory, with its laboring steam engine and its busy hum of whirling wheels, is rising up in Ibetr place to change the whole lace of things in this ancient and honored metropolis of the "workers in the gentle craft of leather." . . . Of course, the new system is yet in its infancy— the business is yet in a transition state. But the wheels of revolution are moving rapidly, and they never move backward.

I heard something, as we read the letter together in the darkened room, that was mote than the words seemed to say. There was an elation, a hint of triumph such as had never been in my father's letter* before. I " an not tell how I knew it I felt u stirring, a straining in my father's letter.
