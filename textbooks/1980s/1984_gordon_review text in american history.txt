Adams lost popularity with pro-war Federalists at home, but he restored the peace. While the crisis with France was at its height, Federalist partisans in Congress secured the passage of four laws, known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. Some Federalists claimed that the laws were meant to protect the United States from alien agitators. However, the chief purpose of the laws was to weaken the Democratic-Republican party. 1. The Naturalization Act increased from 5 to 14 years the time required for immigrants to become American citizens. The Federalists wanted to lengthen the naturalization process since most immigrants, upon becoming citizens, voted for Democratic-Republican candidates. 2. The Alien Act empowered the President to deport any alien whom he considered dangerous to the United States. The Alien Enemies Act authorized detention of enemy aliens in time of war. Although not used by Adams, these two laws caused some aliens to leave the country and frightened others to refrain from speaking out against the Federalists. 3. The Sedition Act provided fines and imprisonment for any person who uttered or wrote "false, scandalous, and malicious" statements against Congress or the President. Even Hamilton disapproved this law, and many people considered it a violation of the First Amendment. Nevertheless, the Sedition Act remained in effect and was used to bring to trial and convict ten Democratic-Republican printers and editors. Instead of weakening the Democratic-Republican party, the Alien and Sedition Acts actually strengthened it. Many people felt that the Federalist party threatened their civil liberties. Democratic-Republican leaders took advantage of the situation to gain votes for their party. At the urging of Madison and Jefferson, the state legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky passed resolutions condemning these acts as unconstitutional. The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions presented the states' rights doctrine, claiming that (1) the federal government was created by the states to serve is their agent, and (2i state legislatures could declare laws of Congress unconstitutional and therefore null and void. Madison and Jefferson intended these resolutions primarily as campaign documents for the 1800 Presidential election. Nevertheless, the idea of nullification was to plague the United States until the supremacy of the federal government was conclusively established by the Civil War. factory owners turned to new labor-saving machines. Labor was also scarce in the West. Farmers eagerly turned to new farm machinery to increase their productivity. 8. Wasteful Agriculture. Since land was so easily available, frontiersmen were not mindful of the need for conservation of soil and forests. They cut down trees senselessly and cultivated the land unwisely, destroying its fertility. Turner stated that the close of the frontier, ending the era of cheap or free land, caused many of the problems that face us today. 1. Labor. Discontented factory workers no longer had the "safety valve" of easily available land in the West. These workers therefore remained in the industrial East and turned to labor unions to improve their conditions. The struggle between capital and labor now intensified. 2. Immigration. Immigrants could no longer easily acquire farms. More of them now crowded into the cities and competed for jobs in the factories. Americans began to demand restrictions upon immigration. 3. Conservation. With the close of the frontier, the American people awakened to the need for conservation. Farmers realized that they had to lake better care of their land. Timber and mining companies came to the same realization about their resources. Federal and state agencies started projects to conserve the nation's soil, water, timber, anti other natural resources. 4. Imperialism. American capitalists, who had looked to the frontier for raw materials, markets, and investment opportunities, now began to look elsewhere. As a result, the United States embarked on a program of economic and political imperialism in the Caribbean, Central and South America. and the Far East. Many historians believe that Turner exaggerated the importance of the frontier. They claim that Turner ignored the following facts: (1) American democracy was fostered by our democratic heritage from England and by the demands of workers in the industrial East for a voice in government. (2) England developed a democratic form of government without the existence of a frontier. (3) The Southwestern frontier, settled by cotton planters, developed neither democracy nor nationalism. (4) The frontier did not serve as a "safety valve" for many Eastern factory workers, since they lacked fenders of our existing farm programs emphasized that these programs provided the nation with sufficient supplies of food and fiber at reasonable prices. 4. American Crain and the Soviet Union—From Embargo to a New Pact. Tb make the Soviets "pay" for their 1979-1980 invasion of Afghanistan, President Carter barred the sale of most American grain to the Soviet Union. Opponents of the embargo claimed that it harmed American farmers more, that it did not cause the Soviets to modify their Afghan policy, and that it had minimal economic effect upon the Soviet Union—merely causing the Soviets to purchase grain from other grain-exporting nations. In 1981 President Reagan, while expressing opposition to Soviet "acts of aggression," cited the ineffectiveness of the embargo and ordered its end. In 1983 American and Soviet representatives agreed on a new pact that allowed the Soviets, for five years, to purchase substantial quantities of American grain. When in late 1983 the Soviets shot down the Korean commercial airliner, killing its 269 passengers. President Reagan expressed America's outrage but he made no move to disrupt the grain pact. 5. Problem of the Poor in Rural Areas a. Impoverished Farmers. Two million farmers are unable to earn a decent living in agriculture. Eventually, some will achieve profitable farm operations. Others will combine farming with part-time employment in industry. Most will leave the soil. The government in the 1960's assisted these farmers by laws: providing loans for low-income farmers to expand their landholdings; creating new rural jobs by community projects, such as home repairs and water-system construction; encouraging new industry in rural areas: and granting funds for vocational training of farmers and farm youths. b. Migratory Workers. These workers total possibly a quarter million. They travel from region to region and find employment chiefly on large commercial farms at peak periods such as harvest-time. Working about 140 days a year and earning very little, they lived in extreme poverty. Until the 1960's their plight evoked little government concern, and their efforts to form unions were blocked by the commercial farmers. In 1964 the migratory workers benefited when Congress prohibited the importation of temporary Mexican farm laborers. In 1965 California migratory workers, mainly Chicanos, went on strike for recognition of their AFL-CIO union, the United Farm Workers (UFW), led by Cesar Chavez. With public support, they won contracts from the m"yor grape and lettuce growers. Part 1. The American People Come From Many Lands Except for the Indians, all Americans arc immigrants or the descendants J of immigrants. During the colonial period, settlers came by the thousands. 1 From the end of the American Revolution to today, some 45 million people liave migrated to our shores. 1. Economic. European farmers were discouraged as they tried to reap an adequate crop from small and worn-out lands. Farmers were driven from the soil as the Agricultural Revolution brought about a change from subsistence to large-scale commercial farming. European city workers were disheartened by low wages, and many workers faced unemployment as the Industrial Revolution hastened the use of machines. Immigrants looked to America as a land of opportunity, where fertile lands could be acquired at little or no cost and where the expanding economy provided steady employment at decent wages. II Political. Most European governments were controlled by the upper classes, and the common people had little or no say in political matters. Immigrants looked to democratic America, where the ordinary citizen had a strong voice in the government. 1 3. Social. European society was characterized by rigid class distinctions, j few educational opportunities for the lower classes, and discrimination ■ against religious minorities. As World War I approached, most governments Inquired young men to serve terms of compulsory' military service. Immi- Igrants looked to America as a land of equality, where they could rise in so- 1 dal status, provide an education for their children, practice their religion [ without fear, and l>e free of compulsory military service. I Immigrants were the uprooted, having left their friends, relatives, and , native lands. Being poor, most immigrants came in the most undesirable sec- Itions of ships, where conditions were often crowded and unsanitary. In the United States, they faced the hardships of having to adjust to a new language and culture. Nevertheless, they were eager to seek their new homeland. 1. Major Periods of Immigration a. To the Age of Jackson (1783-1830). At first, immigrants came in a slow hut steady stream. Immigration increased as travel became easier with the close of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. During the years 1821-1830. 143,000 immigrants came to the United States. h. To the Beginning of the Civil War (1831-1860). In the next three decades, immigrants came in rapidly rising numbers: 1831-1840 : 600,000: 1841-1850: 1.700,000; 1851-1860: *2,600,000. Most of these immigrants came from Ireland and Germany. The Irish, long denied self-government by England, received their main stimulus to migrate in the 1840's, when they were afflicted by a potato famine. Germans who had migrated for economic reasons were joined, after the failure of the Revolution of 1848, by German liberals and intellectuals, who came to escape political persecution. c. To the Close of the Frontier (1861-1890). After being temporarily slowed by the Civil War, immigration again began rising, from 2,800,000 in the years 1871 1880 to 5.200.000 in the years 1881-1890. Immigrants after the Civil War were attracted by the claims of agents and by advertisements of steamship companies and land-grant railroads, and by "America letters" of praise sent by earlier immigrants. Immigrants continued coming from England, Ireland, and Germany. Farmers came from the Scandinavian countries of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark to look for abundant and fertile soil. 2. Americans Welcomed Immigration. Most Americans considered immigrants an asset to our growing nation. Immigrants represented (a) workers for factories, mines, and railroads, (6) farmers for Western lands, (c) consumers for the products of agriculture and industry, (d i men of special abilities, talents, and skills, and (e) military' strength for the nation. Americans took pride in their country's tradition as a haven for the oppressed. Emma Lazarus expressed the feelings of most Americans in her poem "The New Colossus," which is inscribed on the base of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor: "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." 3. Early Opposition to Immigration: The "Know-Nothings." Some Americans disapproved of the Irish and German immigrants for taking jobs away from nati%re Americans, for failing to assimilate into American society, and mostly just for being Catholic. By the 1850's nativist (anti-foreignI and anti-Catholic groups had formed a number of societies, the most influential being the Know-Nothings. This society was so called because its members, pledged to secrecy, answered "I know nothing" when asked about the soci- I ety. The Know-Nothings purported to defend Protestantism against Catholicism and sought to restrict immigration. To further their goals, they ran j candidates for political office. Despite initial political gains, the society soon died out, as Americans rejected religious intolerance and concentrated upon the problems of slavery and sectionalism. 4. "Old Immigrants": Characteristics. Historians have traditionally re! ferred to the Europeans coming before 1890 as the "old immigrants." i! They originated chiefly from northern and western Europe: Great Britain, • Ireland, Germany. Holland, France, and the Scandinavian countries of Den- 1 mark, Norway, and Sweden. They arrived while the frontier was still open, and many settled on farms in the West. It has been claimed that, since these "old immigrants" possessed customs and traditions similar to those of Americans, they adjusted easily to American ways of life. 1. "New Immigrants": Characteristics. Historians have traditionally referred to the Europeans coming after 1890 as the "new immigrants." They came in greater numbers than immigrants had ever come before. From 1901 to 1910 some 8.800.000 persons entered the United States. Unlike the "old immigrants," the "new immigrants" originated chiefly in southern and eastern Europe: Italy, Greece, Austria-Hungary, Serbia, Rumania, Russian Poland, and Russia. They arrived when the frontier was closed and therefore fettled chiefly in the cities as factory workers. It has been claimed that, since the "new immigrants" possessed customs and traditions different from those of Americans, they experienced difficulty in adjusting to American ways of life. 2. Typical Migratory Groups. Italians, Serbs, and Greeks fled poverty. Peoples in the despotic Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires fled heavy taxes and, as World War I approached, compulsory military service. Jews in Russia and in Russian-controlled Poland had long been forced to live in special districts, called the Pale of Settlement, and had been subjected to educational restrictions and to legal and economic discrimination. They now fled Czarist-inspired outbreaks of anti-Semitic violence, called pogroms. 3. Opposition to Immigration. Many Americans disapproved of the "new immigrants," arguing as follows: (a) With the frontier closed, there was no more free or cheap land for immigrants. (6) American industry had sufficient workers, and "new immigrants" competed with and took jobs away from native Americans. This argument was emphasized by labor unions, (c) The "new' immigrants" were difficult to Americanize. They had little education. They settled in large cities, creating their own ghettos, and felt no need to learn American ways. Their ghettos were becoming breeding places of disease and crime, (d) Some people* argued that the "new' immigrants" w'ere physically and mentally inferior to the "old immigrants." This was known as the "theory of Nordic supremacy." 4. In Defense of the "New Immigrants." (a) Tin1 "new immigrants" assimilated as wrell as had the Irish and German "old immigrants." Critics of the "new immigrants" forgot that the Germans, too, had clung to their native tongue and that the Irish had been impoverished and uneducated. Tire Irish and the Germans had also been accused of being clannish and of not assimilating quickly into the American Protestant society. (6) The "new immigrants" who flocked to the cities were joined by native Americans who moved in from the farms. Both groups contributed to the urban problems of slums, disease, and crime. Again, critics of the "new immigrants" forgot that the Irish, too, had settled in the cities. (c| The "new immigrants" provided the additional workers needed by our growing industry. Furthermore, they stimulated industrial growth by enlarging the domestic market for goods. (d) Reputable scientists rejected the theory of Nordic supremacy as false. (e) The "new immigrants" contributed greatly to American life. 1. The Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) began the prohibition of the immigration of Chinese. The law was passed following agitation and riots on the West Coast against cheap "coolie" labor. The prohibition lasted until World War II. 2. The Gentlemen's Agreement (19071 contained a promise by the Japanese government to deny passports to Japanese laborers seeking to migrate to the United States. Negotiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, it followed anti-Japanese race riots in California, and local and state laws di>- criminating against Japanese immigrants. In 1924 Congress unilaterally ended the Gentlemen's Agreement by prohibiting all Japanese immigration to the United States. 3. The Literacy Test Act (1917) required immigrants to be able to read English or their own language before entering the United States. This ait was passed over a veto by President Wilson, who insisted that literacy' indicated not mental ability, but merely that an immigrant had received the opportunity to go to school. As World War I ended, Americans withdrew emotionally from world affairs, and their isolationist sentiments reinforced their opposition to immigration. Americans experienced a "Red scare," occasioned by the 1917 Communist seizure of Russia, and feared that foreign radicals would infiltrate the United States. The Ku KIux Klan added its voice to demand protection of "white Protestant America." Congress passed the following: 1. Two Emergency Immigration Acts, in 1921 and in 1924, began the sharp curtailment of immigration from outside the Western Hemisphere. The 1924 act also contained regulations constituting the 1929 National Origins Plan. 2. National Origins Plan of 1929 a. Provisions. This plan (1) permitted no more than 150,000 immigrants from outside the Western Hemisphere to enter the United States per year, ! (2) allotted each country a quota in proportion to the number of persons in the I United States having that national origin according to the census of 1920, (3) granted each eligible nation at least 100 immigrants per year, (4) placed no restrictions on immigration from the Western Hemisphere, and (5) prohibited all immigration from Asian countries. (After World War II, most Asian countries received a quota of 100 immigrants per year.) b. Effects. The National Origins Plan, coupled with the Depression of 1929, sharply curtailed immigration. From 1931 to 1940, a total of only 530,000 immigrants arrived at our shores. Most quotas remained unfilled. After World War II. Europe contained many millions of refugees, or dis~ I placed persons, including (II survivors of the German concentration camps, 1 especially Jews, anti-Nazi Germans, and anti-Nazis of nations overrun by Germany who wanted to start life anew', far from Europe, (2) slave laborers, [chiefly eastern Europeans, who had bren forced to work in Germany during ' the war and who refused to return home to Communist rule, and (3) escap- lecs from Communist rule in eastern Europe. The plight of the refugees j touched American sympathies. Congress passed several Displaced Persons Acts which by 1956 allowed into the United States some 600,000 refugees above the yearly immigration quotas. McCARRAN-WALTER IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT OF 1952 1. Provisions. The new law (a) restated the National Origins Plan by setting a limit of 154,000 immigrants per year and by granting each country a quota based on the 1920 census, (6) allowed each Asian country a quota, usually 100 immigrants per year, (c) required the careful screening of immigrants to keep out security risks, and (d) eased the procedures for revoking the citizenship of recently naturalized citizens who joined Communist or Communist-front organizations and for deporting undesirable aliens. 2. Arguments for Ihe Act. (a) The total of 154,000 admissions per year from outside the Western Hemisphere prevented the flooding of the United States with immigrants. (6) The use of the national origins system preserved the "nationality make-up" of our population, (c) The law rejected any racial bias by admitting immigrants from Asian countries, (d) The danger of Communism made necessary the provisions for tighter screening, for revoking citizenship, and for deporting undesirable aliens. 3. Arguments Against the Act. (a) The United States, with its relatively low population density, could absorb a larger number of immigrants ]ht year, (b) The use of national origins quotas discriminated against immigrants from eastern and southern Europe and from Asia. The law assigned a quota of 109,000 out of a total of 154,000 to three countries: Croat Britain, Germany, and Ireland. Unused quotas could not be transferred to nations that had already filled their quotas, (c) The screening provisions were so strict that they might serve to exclude immigrants worthy of admission, (d) The law made recently naturalized citizens into "second-class citizens," since they could be denaturalized and deported for committing certain acts for which natural-born citizens could not be similarly punished. President Truman vetoed the McCarran-Walter Bill as "repressive and inhumane," but Congress overrode the veto. Later, Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson all requested a revision of our immigration laws. IMMIGRATION ACT Of 1965 (WITH 1976 REVISIONS) 1. Provisions. For countries outside the Western Hemisphere, the law (a) abolished the National Origins Plan, (b) established a quota of 170,000 immigrants per year, (c) set a limit of 20,000 immigrants per year from any one nation, and (d) provided standards for admitting immigrants according to the following preferences: (1) close relatives of United States residents, (2) scientists, artists, professional people, and skilled and unskilled workers needed to fill labor shortages, and (3) refugees from Communist rule and from natural calamity. For countries in the Western Hemisphere, the law introduced for the first time a quota of 120,000 immigrants per year and, by the 1976 revisions, subjected them to the same provisions as for other immigrants—a limit of 20,000 per year from any one nation and the same standards of admission. 2. Significant Changes, (a) This law replaced the National Origins Plan, stressing race and nationality, by a preference system emphasizing family relationship, value to the United States, and motive for migrating. (A) It ended the favored position of north and west European nations, and placed them on an equal footing with other countries. Fewer immigrants have come from Great Britain, Ireland, and Germany, (c) It permitted an increase in the number of immigrants from Asia, Africa, and southern and eastern Europe. More immigrants have come from Taiwan, the Philippines, Italy, Greece, and Portugal, (d) The law reduced the number of Western Hemisphere immigrants from about 150,000 unlimited entrants in 1965 to a quota maximum of 120,000. (e) The 1976 revisions reduced Mexican immigration from an annual average of 40,000 to the legal limit of 20,000; spurred illegal Mexican immigration; and increased legal immigration from the Caribbean and Central America. 3. Criticisms and Further Proposals, (a) Each foreign country, regardless of its population, economy, and government, receives the same immigrant quota limit. (6) The legal immigration ceiling of 290,000 per year has been surpassed by the coming of illegal immigrants and by the President's power to exempt refugee groups from the legal ceiling. The United States needs a new realistic maximum immigration ceiling set somewhere between 500,000 and 1 million persons per year, (c) The United States should adopt a flexible quota system, varying the number of immigrants permitted to enter each year according to economic conditions within the United States, (d) The preference system for admitting immigrants should be simplified, (e) The illegal immigrants now in the United States—between 3 million and 6 million— should be granted amnesty and permanent residency status. <f) To discourse further illegal immigration, the United States should require national identity cards as a condition for employment and penalize employers who hire illegal aliens not possessing such cards. As countless refugees fled from their native countries—such as Cuba, Haiti, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, Afghanistan, and Indochina—Congress enacted the 1980 Refugee Act. It (1) defined refugees as people outside their native countries who are unwilling to return because of fear of persecution (this definition did not limit refugees to Communist-ruled nations only); (2) increased the number of refugees to be admitted annually to 50,000—in addition to the existing special programs for Indochinese and Cuban refugees; (3) empowered the President to admit additional refugees in emergency situations; (4) to administer the law, established the position of United States Coordinator of Refugee Affairs. Each group of immigrants faced discrimination at the hands of native Americans—themselves descendants of earlier immigrants. Those immi- nts who settled in cities and sought factory work were particularly sited. (1 > Economically. They were the last to be hired, kept at the poorest jobs, and the first to be fired. (2) Socially. They were confined to ghettos and slums; excluded from the better hotels, restaurants, and clubs; and often refused admission to institutions of higher learning. Nevertheless, by displaying ability and determination, these immigrants achieved success and entered the mainstream of American life. 1. Cultural. The immigrants brought the cultural heritages of their native lands to America. With time, certain features of these heritages died out while other features survived. The surviving features can still he seen in such aspects of American life as our foods, music, literature, sports, and language, all of which reflect a variety of contributions by immigrants. Perhaps most important, the cultural and religious diversity of immigrants promoted a spirit of toleration among most Americans. Because the United States successfully absorbed different peoples and heritages to form an American nationality and culture, the United States has been called a melting pot. 2. Economic. The immigrants were eager for honest, useful work. Immigrants from each nation found employment in many industries. Nevertheless, many groups have become identified with specific industries. Scandinavians farmed the land. Irishmen and Italians built canals, railroads, and bridges. Jews worked in the garment industry. Poles and other Slavs, as well as Hungarians, mined coal and iron ore, and labored in the steel mills. The immigrants increased the demand for the products of agriculture and industry, thereby further encouraging American economic growth. Also, by coming to the United States in especially great numbers during times of business expansion, immigrants served to prevent any shortage of labor. 1. British.

Which was un important cause of immigration to the United States in the 1840's? (1) the Napoleonic Wars (2) changes in our immigration policy (3) revolutions in Europe (4) completion of the first transcontinental railroad. 2. Which event had the most immediate effect upon immigration to the United States? (1) the defeat of France by Prussia in 1870-1871 (2) the potato famine in Ireland (3) the Crimean WTar (4) the gaining of independence by Belgium. 3. In which period did the largest number of immigrants enter the United States? (1) 1789-1810 (2) 1840-1860 ( 3) 1870-1890 ( 4) 1890-1910. 4. The United States had a liberal immigration policy during most of the 19th century because (I) many Congressmen were foreign-born (2) the population of the United States remained constant (3) there was a shortage of labor in the United Stales (4) prosperous times in Europe discouraged immigration to the United States. 5. In the latter part of the 19th century, a liberal immigration policy was generally opposed by (I) Eastern manufacturers (2) land speculators (3) labor unions (4) railroad companies. 8. Where can an expression of the philosophy of the United States concerning immigration be found? (1) in Washington's Farewell Address (2) on the base of the Statue of Liberty (3) in the Clayton Act (4) in the Gettysburg Address. dren, the law barred federal courts from ordering busing beyond the school closest or next closest to the child's home. (2) In 1974 the Supreme Court, in Milliken vs. Bradley, decided by 5 to 4 that children should not be bused across school district lines. The decision prohibited the cross-busing of black children in the urban Detroit school district with the white children in the suburban Detroit school districts. The Court majority held that, unless the districts involved had deliberately practiced discrimination, the Constitution did not require interdistrict busing. (3) In 1982 the Supreme Court upheld a voter-approved amendment to the California constitution that prohibited state courts, in the ahsence of any violation of civil rights, from ordering compulsory busing. 6. Affirmative Action in Education: The Bakke Case—1978. The 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibited discrimination based on race by any educational institution receiving federal funds. Citing this provision, the Office of Education urged college and university admissions offices to redress past discrimination by programs to benefit minority groups—programs known as affirmative action. At the Davis Medical School of the University of California, the admissions office set aside 16 out of 100 positions in the freshman class for members of minority groups—blacks, Chicanos, and Asians. Allan Bakke, a white engineer who had served with the Marines in Vietnam, determined to become a doctor. He twice applied to the Davis Medical School and was twice rejected—although his medical aptitude test scores were higher than some minority group applicants who gained acceptance. Bakke felt that he was a victim of the Davis admissions program of minority quotas, or reverse discrimination. He took legal action claiming that he was being denied his constitutional rights under the "equal protection" clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and was being subjected to racial discrimination for being white, in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 1978, the Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 vote, handed down a complex decision of two major parts: (a) Bakke must be admitted to the Davis Medical School, and the Davis affirmative action program with its set quota for minority students is invalid because it is biased against nonminority applicants. (This part of the decision appealed to persons opposed to quotas and in favor of merit selection of applicants.) (6) Race and ethnic origins may be considered as one of many factors in establishing programs of college admissions. (This part of the decision appealed to persons who supported affirmative action to assist the victims of past discrimination.) Many observers held that the Supreme Court decision was ambiguous and confusing, that most affirmative action programs (in education and employment) would continue as is or as revised, and that further lawsuits would be 2. Urbanization by States and Cities. The most highly urbanized states, with over 85 percent of their populations living in urban areas, are California, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Connecticut, Florida, and Massachusetts. The most rural states, with over 70 percent of their populations still living in rural areas, are Wyoming, South Dakota, Idaho, Vermont, Montana, and Mississippi. Our six most populous cities are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, and San Francisco. 1. Industrial Revolution. As industries arose, workers congregated about the factories. These workers added to existing city populations or created new cities. Because urban dwellers needed food, clothing, entertainment, and professional services, still more people came to the cities. 2. Social and Cultural Attractions. Many people were attracted to cities by social and cultural facilities: colleges and universities, theaters and movies, symphonies, libraries, and lecture forums. 3. Improved Transportation and Communication. The railroads, telegraph lines, and telephones that served the cities enabled the city dwellers to (a) obtain foodstuffs and other essentials, (6) distribute the products of city factories throughout the land, and (c) conduct business transactions quickly and efficiently from a central office. 4. Decreasing Farm Population. Farmers and farm laborers were driven from the countryside by the (a) drabness and hardships of farm life, (b) low agricultural prices and difficult times, especially following the Civil War and again following World War I, and (c) increased mechanization and growth of commercial farming. 5. Immigration From Europe. During the 19th century, some "old immigrants" settled in cities. After the close of the frontier in 1890, the "new1 immigrants" settled chiefly in cities. These urban settlers found jobs in city factories and other businesses. As newcomers unfamiliar with American culture, they preferred to live among fellow immigrants who spoke then- native tongue. Ethnic groups congregated in special city sections, thereby forming ghettos. 6. Migration of Blacks and Hispanics a. Blacks. In the 20th century, blacks left the rural South for urban centers. Some blacks moved to cities in the South, but more moved to cities in the West and North. By 1980, blacks in large numbers inhabited America's most populous cities. b. Hispanics. By 1980 Puerto Ricans lived in and about New York City. Mexican-Americans resided mainly in the cities of the Southwest and West. Cubans settled in the Florida cities of Tampa and Miami. 1. Corruption and Political Machines. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, city "bosses" ruling political machines dominated and victimized a considerable number of cities They corrupted city governments by selling justice in local courts, giving city franchises and contracts to businessmen in return for presents and favors, and filling city jobs with unqualified political henchmen. Most political machines were eventually ousted from power through the combined efforts of reform leaders, crusading newspapers, and an aroused citizenry. In the early 20th century the muckraker Lincoln Steffens did much to make the public aware of corruption in city government by his book The Shame of the Cities. Today, although occasional cases of corruption among city officials are still disclosed, bossism does not present nearly the problem that it did at the turn of the century. 2. City-State Relationship. City governments are "creatures of the state." They were created by state-granted charters and exercise powers as enumerated in these charters. Some cities complain that the state does not grant them sufficient home rule. Cities that do not have home-rule charters must obey state directives on local problems and must secure permission from the state legislature to widen their powers over such matters as transportation and taxation. Many cities, including New York City, also complain that the state treats a city unfairly by collecting more money in state taxes from the city's residents than the state returns to the city in the form of services and state-aid funds. 3. Demands for More City Services. Cities have faced demands from their inhabitants for more and better services. City aid is especially needed in ghettos occupied by disadvantaged Negroes and other minorities. As a result, cities have expanded their facilities in recreation, education, housing, transportation, welfare assistance, and public health; and city expenditures have soared. 4. Decrease in the City Tax Base. Especially since the end of World War II, middle-class and upper middle-class families have left the cities for more tion for cities and suburbs in both bouses of state legislatures and in the federal House of Representatives. City officials hope that this change will mean greater attention by legislatures to urban problems. 1. Extent of Poverty. In I960, despite our post-VVorld War II affluence, 10 million American families lived in poverty. They struggled to secure the necessities of life with yearly incomes of less than $3000. These 10 million impoverished families, about 4 million being rural and 6 million urban, totaled 35 million individuals, or about 20 |>ercent of our total population. 2. Causes of Poverty a. Lack of Training. Millions of Americans have never received vocational or professional training. Filling only low-skill or no-skill jobs, they receive little pay and face frequent unemployment. b. Worn-Out Farms. Many small farmers, working a few acres of exhausted land, eke out a difficult living. They lack the capital to acquire sizable fertile lands and to buy expensive machines. They live in areas that do not afford adequate health and educational facilities. A number of rural poor have abandoned their farms and moved to the cities, but, lacking education and skills, they remain impoverished. c. Old Age. With medical science prolonging life, the number of aged has steadily increased. Unable to find work, many old persons find their incomes reduced to the poverty level. d. Death or Desertion of the Father. Many families are {dunged into poverty when the father dies or deserts his family. The mother, lacking job skills and burdened by young children, is unable to support a family by herself. e. Discrimination. Minority groups, including Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and Negroes, have suffered discrimination in education, housing, and jobs. They suffer poverty both because of discrimination in hiring and because of their lack of skills. Children of impoverished families are often born into an environment of despair and hopelessness, and do not receive the training necessary to rise out of poverty. From generation to generation, they remain chained to a cycle of poverty. 2. Beginnings of Civil Service Reform. Hayes antagonized the regular, or ''Stalwart," Republicans by trying to curtail political patronage: dismissing unneeded and incompetent employees; forbidding officeholders from being assessed political contributions; and naming as his Secretary of the Interior the Liberal Republican advocate of civil service reform, Carl Schurz. 3. Hayes' Anti-Labor Acts, (n) Hayes employed federal troops in 1877 against the railroad strikers, (b) Hayes vetoed a Chinese exclusion bill, claiming that it violated our treaty with China. He was condemned as favoring cheap "coolie" labor. The Bland-Allison Act 11878), passed over Hayes' veto, provided that the government purchase and coin a limited quantity of silver. CtARFIELD-ARTHUR ADMINISTRATION: 1881-1885 1. Election of 1S80. The Republican convention, split between rival factions, turned on the 3Gth ballot to a compromise candidate, Ohio Congressman James A. Garfield. The Democrats nominated a former Union general, Winfield ,S. Hancock-. The campaign was undistinguished as to issues, but the Republicans were well organized and expended heavy funds. Despite a very slim lead in popular votes, Garfield won easily in the electoral college. 2. Assassination of Garfield (1881). In office loss than four months. Garfield was fatally shot by a disappointed officeseeker. He was succeeded by his Vice President, Chester A. Arthur. 3. Arthur as President (1881-1885): The Office Makes the Man. Though he had been a machine politician, Arthur rose to the responsibilities of his office by maintaining an able and honest administration. He began modernization of the American navy by constructing steel warships; fought corruption; and strongly supported civil service reform. f 1) The Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), passed after revision of our treaty obligations with China, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers. (2) The Pendleton Act 11883) set the basis of our present federal civil service system. occupation of Vera Cruz and the pursuit of Villa into Mexican territory. They further feared "Yankee imperialism" and American economic power. During World War I Mexico was unfriendly toward the United States. In turn, many Americans disliked the actions of the Mexican government. American Catholics protested Mexico's seizure of Church lands and the closing of parochial schools. American oil interests objected to Mexico's nationalization in 1938 of all foreign-owned oil properties. 6. The Good Neighbor Policy (Since 1933). President Franklin D. Roosevelt acknowledged Mexico's right to seize the oil properties but demanded fair compensation for the foreign investors. Mexico complied with this request. The friendly conclusion to this dispute improved Mexican-American relations. In World War II, Mexico was a firm illy of the United States. 7. Recent Mexican-American Problems a, Energy Supplies. In the 1970's Mexico uncovered huge deposits of natural gas and oil. These energy supplies, if sold to the United States, could reduce American dependence on the volatile Middle East oil-producing nations—Iran and various Arab states. Although Mexico is not a member of OPEC, its energy prices conform to the high OPEC price policies. The United States would like to see a halt to rising energy prices and possibly even a decline. In 1979 the two nations reached agreement on the price for Mexican natural gas to be sold to the United States. h. Illegal Immigrants. The illegal Mexican immigrants (also known as Vftwcfcs") in the United States are estimated to total 7 million. They are attracted primarily to the American Southwest by job opportunities and by wages higher than those paid in Mexico. If caught by the American authorities, these "illegals" face only deportation to Mexico. The United States holds that these illegal immigrants create problems: breaking our laws, perpetuating slums, depressing wage standards, and taking jobs away from American citizens. Mexico claims that the United States has made no serious effort to deal with this mass influx of human beings, that American employers I exploit the "illegals" by paying substandard wages, and that American im- I migration authorities treat the "illegals" with unnecessary harshness. c. Winter Vegetable Exports. Mexico exports large quantities of winter I vegetables to the United States. American vegetable growers in Florida 1 protest that the Mexicans are "dumping" their produce here at low prices, I and they demand protection. If tariffs or other restrictions were imposed, American growers and their farmworkers would benefit, but other conse- j puces might be: higher vegetable prices in the United States, fewer jobs for Mexican farmworkers, reduced Mexican imports of American goods, and I more bitterness in Mexican-American relations. In 1980 the Commerce Department ruled that Mexico was not selling its winter produce here at unfairly low prices, and therefore no restrictions should be placed upon imports of Mexican winter vegetables. naval power unless for aggression. No agreement was reached; soon afterwards Japan started a new naval race. 3. The United States Joins in International Pacts a. Nine-Power Treaty at the Washington Conference (1921-1922). The United States. Japan, Britain. France, and five smaller nations agreed to support equal trading rights in China and to respect China's independence, thus reaffirming the Open Door Policy. b. Kellogg-Briand Pact (792#). Frank Kellogg, American Secretary of State, and Aristide Briand, French Foreign Minister, proposed a pact to settle all disputes peacefully anti to outlaw war "as an inst rument of national policy." Most nations, including Germany, Japan, and Italy, signed this idealistic statement, also called the Pact of Paris. c. Failure of International Pacts. In the 1930's militarist Japan, Fascist Italy, and Nazi Germany all violated the Kellogg-Briant 1 Pact. Japan also violated the Nine-Power Treaty. Without provision for enforcement and without restraining action by the other signatories, these agreements proved worthless. 1. Refusal to Join the World Court. The World Court was established by the League to settle disputes between nations according to international law. Despite the requests of four successive Presidents-—Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, and Roosevelt—Senate isolationists managed to keep the United States from membership in the World Court. They insisted that the World Court was a "back door" into the League. 2. Immigration Restrictions. Congress passed a series of immigration laws reversing our "open house" policy and drastically limiting admissions. Congress thus expressed American sentiment for fewer world contacts—an aspect of isolationism. 3. High Tariff Policy. Congress restored high import duties and in 1930 passed the highest rates ever. By such protectionism. Congress reflected the isolationist viewr in economic matters. 4. Insistence Upon Repayment of War Debts. During World War I the European Allies—mainly Britain, France, and Italy—had borrowed $10 billion from the United States. Thereafter, the Allies suggested that the United States cancel the war debts because they (n) had spent the money, chiefly for American war materials, to secure victory for the United States ns well as for themselves, (f>) could not repay as long as America's high tariffs made it difficult for them to secure dollars, and (c) could not repay unless they chief he planned the overall war strategy: first beat Hitler, then Japan. He met with top Allied leaders in several wartime conferences. On the home front, Roosevelt established an array of government agencies to direct the economy toward winning the war. b. Economic Mobilization, (1) The War Production Board (WPB) ordered military equipment, shifted peacetime plants to war production, set up priorities for raw materials, and built new plants, most notably to produce aluminum and synthetic rubber. During the war years, total industrial production almost doubled. (21 The War Labor Board (WLB) settled labor- management disputes, permitted wage increases to help offset the rising cost of living, and endeavored to prevent strikes. With a few exceptions, unions adhered to their no-strike pledge. (3) The War Manpower Commission (WMC) trained workers and channeled them into essential industries, supervised the Selective Service system, and recruited new workers, including several million women. i4i The Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) encouraged maximum use of labor by combatting racial and religious discrimination in employment. (5) The Office of Price Administration (OPA) com- batted inflation by imposing price and rent ceilings and by rationing scarce consumer goods, such as sugar, meat, shoes, and gasoline. From 1939 to 1945 the cost of living rose about 30 percent, far less than during World War 1. c. Civil Liberties. Except for the forced removal of Japancsc-Amcricans from the West Coast to interior relocation centers, civil liberties survived the war strains. Compared to World War I, the nation experienced less war hysteria. The press and the people remained free to criticize the government, and vigorous debate marked the Presidential election of 1944, in which Roosevelt won a fourth term. d. Wartime Finances. The federal government greatly increased corporate and individual income tax rates and for the first time taxed individuals in the low-income brackets. The number of taxpayers rose from 8 million to almost 55 million. The government introduced a pay-as-you-go system by which employers withheld (deducted in advance) the estimated tax from each worker's paycheck. The government also raised anti expanded excise taxes. Of the total war cost of 1330 billion, taxes provided one-third. The rest, the government borrowed through the sale of war bonds. From 1940 to 1945 the federal debt rose from less than $50 billion to over $250 billion. e. Military Manpower. With draft boards under the Selective Service system providing most of the recruits, the armed forces enrolled 15 million Americans. At peak strength the army totalled %x/> million men, the navy 3C million, and the marines half a million. To release men for frontline duty, women's branches—Army Wacs, Navy Waves, and Women Marines—took over necessary noncombat duties.
