And he promised the coun-try "a wise and frugal Government, which shallrestrain men from injuring one another[and]leave them otherwise free to regulate their ownpursuits."Jefferson quickly demonstrated the sincerity ofhis remarks. He saw to it that the Whiskey Taxand other Federalist excises were repealed, and hemade sharp cuts in military and naval expendituresto keep the budget in balance. The national debtwas reduced from $83 million to $57 million duringhis eight years in office.

546THE RESPONSE TO INDUSTRIALISMtraffic. Improved transportation wrought changesin the economies of many European countries thatcaused an increase in the flow of people to America.Cheap wheat from the United States, Russia, andother parts of the world could now be importedinto western Europe, bringing disaster to farmersin England, Germany, and the Scandinavian coun-tries. The spreading industrial revolution led tothe collapse of the peasant economy of central andsouthern Europe. For rural inhabitants this meantthe loss of self-sufficiency, the fragmentation oflandholdings, poverty, and for many the decisionto make a new start in the New World. Politicaland religious persecutions pushed still others intothe migrating stream. However, the main reasonfor immigration remained the desire for economicbetterment. "In America," a British immigrant said,"you get pies and puddings."While immigrants continued to people thefarms of America, industry absorbed an ever-in-creasing number of them.
