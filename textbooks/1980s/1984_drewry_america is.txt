They think of it as a recent discovery with a fairly brief history. Nothing could be further from the truth. The roots of American history stretch far back into the past. To understand the land and its peoples, it is necessary to go back and look at the earth tens of thousands of years ago. 1. The Beginning________________________________________ The earth is very old and continues to go through many changes in the way it looks. These changes usually happen over long periods of time. This is especially true during the parts of earth history known as the Ice Ages. Then the general climate of the earth slowly grows cold. The moisture escaping from the oceans and seas, which usually returns as rain, falls mostly as snow. It becomes packed into glaciers—heavy, giant sheets of solid ice that move slowly across the land. With less rain returning to them, the oceans are lower than before and more land shows. 1.1 The Land Bridge. The latest Ice Age began about 70,000 bc., reached its peak about 40,000 b.c., and ended about 10,000 bc. Glaciers covered the most northern parts of Asia, Europe, and North America at different times during this Ice Age. The oceans then were much lower than they are today. Sometimes land showed between Asia and North America. It formed a land bridge which is now covered by the waters of the Bering Strait. Small bands of people in Asia migrated—moved from one place to settle in another—as land was covered and uncovered by the glaciers. Some migrated north and east when the earth's climate grew warmer. They followed the herds of animals moving slowly into newly opened lands, and their lives depended on their skills as hunters. The herds of moose, elk, and caribou were the people's major food. The animals and their hunters drifted into the land bridge area. Over hundreds of years, they migrated across it and into parts of what is now Alaska. They were the first people in the Western Hemisphere. 1.2 Early People in America. The spread of people over the Western Hemisphere took many thousands of years. Some areas became free of ice during the warmer stages of the Ice Age. People moved through these areas into the body of North America. Some followed the rivers and streams toward the east. Others moved south and west along the Rocky Mountains. And there were some groups that moved farther south through Middle America deep into South What is a land bridge? Why did people cross the land bridge? The First Americans 5 The English took more than 100 years to build their colonial empire in North America. Starting with Jamestown in 1607, they founded a string of colonies along the Atlantic coast. By the 1730's, the English had 13 colonies, stretching from French Canada in the north to Spanish Florida in the south. The 13 English colonies were different from each other in many ways. They had their own local governments and their own ways of life. The people who settled in the colonies had come to the New World for many different reasons. All of these people added to the growth and variety of American culture. 1. The People of the English Colonies___________________________________ People from several countries immigrated to (came to live in) the English colonies of North America. By 1700, the colonies had about 250,000 people. This number increased ten times in the next 75 years. By 1775, the population of the English colonies was about 2.5 million. Most of the people were white Europeans who wanted to come to the New World. They hoped to have religious freedom, to escape poverty, and to find new ways of improving their lives. Some who arrived in the colonies were forced to come. This was especially true of the black people from Africa. 1.1 The English. About 60 percent of the white settlers in the English colonies were of English nationality. They brought many English ways with them, and their language became the common one in the colonies. Most of them belonged to one of the Protestant religious groups. The largest group of settlers were members of the middle class. They lived in rural (country) areas, where they farmed small plots of land. Some worked as blacksmiths, carpenters, or stonecutters. Some lived in the few urban (city) areas along the Atlantic coast, where they worked in shops, on ships, or with machines. A small number of colonists from England were members of the upper class. In the northern colonies, they became merchants, ministers, doctors, and lawyers. In the southern colonies, they were wealthy planters, owners of large farms known as plantations. 1.2 The Scots. The next largest group of English-speaking white settlers (about 14 percent) were Scots. Many came from southern Scotland, where they had worked as weavers and mechanics. The How much did population grow over time? What were English settlers like? Colonial Society 83 Why did Germans come to America? What were some contributions of non-English-speak- ing European settlers? When did blacks first come to America? largest single group of Scots in America were the so-called Scotch-Irish. They were Scots whom the English government had forced to resettle in the province of Ulster in northern Ireland. They had been treated harshly by the English and hated by the Irish. They sought peace and safety in America. Most of the Scots who first came to America settled in Pennsylvania. In the early 1700's, some moved farther southwest, toward the mountain valleys of the Appalachians. 1.3 The Germans. One of the largest groups of non-English- speaking Europeans to come to the 13 colonies (8.7 percent) were Germans. The Germans left their homeland in the early 1700's to escape war and hunger. Most settled in Pennsylvania's Susquehanna Valley around Lancaster and York. Sometimes they were called Pennsylvania Dutch because the German word for "German" is Deutsch. The political freedom offered by Pennsylvania, together with the richness of the land, provided opportunities for many Germans to become successful. Most became well-to-do farmers. A few made a profitable living making and selling wagons and hardware. 1.4 Other European Settlers. In addition to the Germans, there were several other groups of non-English-speaking European settlers. The Dutch (3.4 percent), located mostly in the Hudson Valley region of New York, contributed many things to American life. Their brick houses with tile roofs were stronger than the wooden planks and shingles of most colonial houses. Their pottery, kitchenware, and iron hardware were both well designed and useful. The French settled in many colonies. Making up about 1.7 percent of the population, they provided America with many artists and artisans. Swedes and Finns, 0.7 percent of all colonists, established settlements throughout the Delaware Valley. They developed ways to build log cabins that later became popular among settlers moving farther west. 1.5 The Africans. The beginning of the black population in the English colonies came in 1619 when a Dutch ship left 20 Africans in Jamestown. Before the end of the century, many more Africans were brought to the colonies. They were captured in wars or kidnapped by slave traders along the coast of West Africa. Their trip to America was a terrible ordeal. Slave ships were horribly crowded, and people were poorly fed. Thousands of Africans died on the ships before reaching America. During the colonial period, Africans became the largest single non-English group in the English colonies. In 1700, there were more than 25,000 slaves. By 1750, there were over 235,000. And in 1775, there were some 500,000 slaves in the English colonies—about 20 84 Colonial Society Colonial Population, 1630-1780 Percent of Nationality Groups, 1775 Estimated Population Swedes and Finns .6% Total colonial population increased 100 times between 1630 and 1720.

Just as the white population had grown ten times between 1700 and 1775, so had America's black population. 1. From what countries did the various people in the English colonies come? 2. Where did the people of various national backgrounds settle in the colonies? 3. How did the trip to the New World of blacks differ from that of whites? 2. Life in the English Colonies______________________________________ The people who came to live in the various parts of the English colonies had many different manners and customs. Gradually, the immigrants to the New World began to form a way of life that was different in many ways from the one they had in the Old World. They began to shape an American way of life. b r J What did the vast 2.1 Work Roles. The vast majority of white settlers in the majority of colonists English colonies worked as farmers.

Notice also the triangular trade routes. What three areas did this trade connect? What goods were traded? Colonial Trade Routes brought to New England. This routine became known as the triangular trade. What colonies made up the Middle Colonies? Who ran education in the Middle Colonies? 3.2 The Middle Colonies. The people in the Middle Colo- nies—New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware—were quite different in their national backgrounds and religious beliefs. The Scots were mostly Presbyterian. The largest religious group among the Germans, Finns, and Swedes was Lutheran. The Dutch were Reformed. Lutheran, and Catholic. Most of the French were Huguenots (Protestants). Quakers, Baptists, and Methodists were mainly English and Welsh. The Jews who settled in New York and Philadelphia in the 1600's were Spanish and Portuguese. Differences in nationality and religion prevented close political cooperation in the Middle Colonies. Town meetings were not used. Instead, decisions were usually made by government officials in an elected colonial assembly. Public education in the Middle Colonies was not widespread. There were a number of schools and academies, usually run by private or church groups. Several schools of higher education were founded in the 1700's. The College of New Jersey, started in 1746 by the 92 Colonial Society Presbyterians, later became Princeton University. The Philadelphia College was chartered in 1754 and later became the University of Pennsylvania. The Church of England set up Columbia University in New York City in 1754. And the Dutch Reformed Church^ounded RuigersTIniversity irTt766 in New Jersey. Farming was the main way of making a living in the Middle Colonies. The size of the farms varied. There were the huge estates of the Dutch in New York. There were the small farms of the Germans and the Scots in Pennsylvania. Because all the farms produced mostly grains—com, wheat, rye, barley—the Middle Colonies became known as the "Bread Colonies." The land of the Middle Colonies was more fertile than that in New England. It produced more than enough for the people who lived there to use. Farmers sold their surplus goods. Three important rivers—the Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna—which cut through the area were ways for farmers to move these goods to the merchants in the coastal cities of New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. During the colonial period, manufacturing in the Middle Colonies was usually done by people in their homes. Family members spun and wove textile goods, and artisans worked with iron, glass, and paper. Outside the home, other industries grew up. Sawmills produced large amounts of lumber, mills provided flour, and ovens baked bricks for building homes. What was grown in the Middle Colonies? A ready supply of trees helped shipbuilding become a profitable industry in the colonies. Shipyards in the New England and Middle colonies built ships for trade and fishing. What kinds of skilled people did a community need to build ships? Colonial Society 93 Who made up the New England Confederation? In New England, the Pequot Indians united in 1637 to drive out the settlers along the Connecticut River. The colonists struck back, killing over 500 men, women, and children in a Pequot camp. In 1643, the colonists of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven joined together in the New England Confederation. A confederation is a loose union of people or groups for shared support and action. The New England Confederation was formed to protect the member colonies against the French and Dutch settlements as well as against the Indians. It was an early example of colonists working together for protection. Several Indian groups in New England joined together under a Wampanoag chief known as "King Philip." In the summer of 1675, they set out to drive the settlers from the land. The Indians attacked settlement after settlement. After the death of King Philip in the spring of 1676, the fighting gradually ended. But the war made longtime enemies of the northeastern Indians and the New England settlers. In Pennsylvania, William Penn and his Quaker followers established good relations with the Indians at first. The settlers usually abided by the terms of treaties. But later they, too, found it easy to force the Indians west. When the Scots and other groups began moving into the western lands during the early 1700's, fighting became more frequent between the settlers and the Indians there. Conflict between the two groups continued all through the colonial period. It provided a powerful force in pulling colonists together for their common defense. What was the basic cause of trouble between the colonies and England? 4.2 The Colonists and the Crown. During the time of settlement, the English did not pay much attention to their colonies. The colonists were allowed to handle their own affairs. After King Charles II came to the throne in 1660, however, the English government decided to set up stricter rules and regulations. It wanted to use the colonies to increase wealth in England. The government began to follow a policy of mercantilism. According to this policy, the colonists were to produce raw materials not found in England. They were supposed to sell these raw materials only to England. In addition, the colonies were not to make anything they could buy from England. To enforce this policy, many laws were passed in England to control colonial trade. The Navigation Acts of the 1660's listed such colonial products as tobacco, cotton, indigo, and turpentine which must be exported to England only. The English government ruled that colonists could import only English goods. All goods traded between the colonies and England had to be carried on English or colonial ships. One of the most profitable businesses in the colonies was the sugar trade with the West Indies. In an effort to stop the colonists from trading with Colonial Society What were the agreements made in the Convention of 1800? At whom were the Alien and Sedition Acts aimed? Why did the Democratic-Republican party oppose Jay's Treaty? Why did the Federalist party favor a pro-British foreign policy? Who would most likely support the Federalist party, a Pennsylvania wheat farmer or a Massachusetts banker? Who would most likely support the Democratic- Republican party, a South Carolina tobacco seller or a Kentucky blacksmith? known as the Convention of 1800, was signed by representatives of the two countries. The United States was released from the Alliance of 1778. In return, the French did not have to pay damages for the American shipping they had destroyed. War had been avoided. 4.4 The Alien and Sedition Acts. Differences between the Federalists and Democratic-Republicans grew stronger as the election of 1800 drew near. The Federalists worried that they might lose the election. They were alarmed at the growth of the Democratic-Republi- can party. Much of it came from immigrants joining that party. In 1798, the Federalists in Congress passed several laws known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. These measures were intended to stop the Democratic-Republicans from gaining more power. One law increased the number of years needed for an alien (person who is not a citizen of the country in which he or she lives) to become a United States citizen. New immigrants then would not be able to vote for some years. In another act, the President was given the power to deport (send out of the country) any foreigner thought to be dangerous to the nation. The Sedition Act said that anyone guilty of sedition—the use of language to stir up rebellion against a government—could be fined and sent to prison. This law was aimed at a group of American newspaper writers who favored the Democratic-Republicans. Political Parties in the 1790's Federalist Democratic-Republican Favored government control by wealthy and educated citizens Political Beliefs Favored the selection of representatives by average citizens Favored a strong national government Favored a limited national government Supported government aid to business, finance, and trade Economic Beliefs Supported no special favors to business; preferred farming Favored a national bank Favored sound state banks Supported protective tariffs Supported duty free imports Favored British commercial ties and feared the French Foreign Affairs Sympathized with the French Revolution Favored Jay's Treaty Opposed Jay's Treaty Strong in New England and seacoast areas Sources of Strength Strong in south, southwest, and frontier areas Manufacturing interests, bankers, and merchants Farmers, artisans, and skilled workers 188 Testing the New Government The Alien and Sedition Acts were used by the party in office to fight their rivals. Although they did not last, they were laws made at a ume when some people thought that strong political actions against the party in office were disloyal and illegal. Slowly people began to understand that party opposition was not only legal but valuable as a check on the party in power. 4.5 The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. The Alien and Sedition Acts were attacked by Democratic-Republicans as unconstitutional. In 1798, Jefferson and Madison wrote papers protesting these acts. Jefferson's ideas were adopted by the legislature of Kentucky and Madison's by Virginia. These papers are known as the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. Jefferson and Madison stated that the federal government had been formed by an agreement among the states. They believed in states' rights—that each state could decide when an act of the government was unconstitutional. A state could declare a law null and void (not binding). The Federalists disagreed. They stated that the government had been formed by the people, and that only the Supreme Court had the power to declare a law unconstitutional. No other state legislatures agreed with Virginia and Kentucky. The questions raised by this issue were important but left to another time to be answered. 4.6 The Election of 1800. The Federalist party was badly divided by 1800. Hamilton and others were angry at President Adams, partly because he had made peace with France. Jefferson had won support for his attack of the Alien and Sedition Acts. In the election, a Democratic-Republican Congress was elected by a slim margin of votes. The results of the presidential election were in question for a while. Originally, the Constitution stated that electors would vote for two names for President. The person receiving the most votes would be President, and the person with the second largest number of votes would be Vice-President. In 1800, however, Jefferson and Aaron Burr, Republican candidate from New York, both received the same number of votes. The tie was settled in the House of Representatives where Jefferson was elected President. In 1804, an amendment was added to the Constitution to keep this from happening again. It said that electors would vote separately for President and Vice-President. What was the basic idea presented in the Resolutions? Who tied for the Presidency in 18001 Who settled the issue? 1.

Who was an important leader in the public school movement? 2.3 New Ideas on Education. Ideas about schools were also changing by the middle of the 1800's. Most schools before then were only for white children. In the South, general education for blacks was not allowed, although some slaves learned to read and write. There were also some independent schools for free black children Elementary schools for whites were most often church schools. There children learned to read and write about their religions. Private schools were mostly for training young men as church, government, and business leaders. Those private schools and colleges often cost too much for most people. The struggle to setup public education was not an easy one. Local and state governments were willing to set land aside for schools. But they often did not vote tax money to help run them. When they did. citizens without children objected. Wealthy parents often did not want to pay for the education of poor children. Church schools were opposed to education without religious training. By the 1830's, this situation was changing. Many Americans began to agree that schools should be free to all children. Citizens needed to be able to read, write, and understand issues in order to vote. Farmers in the West, workers in eastern cities, and newly-arrived immigrants wanted their children to have the chance to improve their lives. There was an increase in the demand for public, tax-supported schools. One of the most important leaders in the public school movement was Horace Mann of Massachusetts. Mann became the secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education in 1837. He supported many reforms and laid the base for teaching as a profession. In Mann's day, many "The Mechanics of Arithmetic" are addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Why does this poster from the 1800's present problems in terms of fruits and vegetables? What other subjects did children at the time learn? THE MECHANICS OF ARITHMETIC. 11 ■rfl rTn 14 W ***"*"- —TV?*- * - ■ 1 it If M l-U "• w . -v - u T - r.iip £ k ztrzzzTZrzz w . . .*'"-"":"--tii w m.

The Changing Population______________________________________ Many changes were taking place in the United States as the country industrialized. More people took jobs in factories and lived in cities. The population of the country was growing rapidly. There was also an increase in immigration to the United States from other areas of the world. When George Washington became President of the United States in 1789, the nation had nearly 4 million people. By 1810. the population had reached 7 million and by 1850, 23 million. Part of this growth came from a heavy flow of immigration beginning in the 1820's. 4.1 Increasing Immigration. During the years from 1820 to 1840, over 700,000 immigrants landed on the shores of the United States. Nearly 60 percent of these people were German or Irish. A second large movement of immigrants to the United States began in the 1840's. In 1846, the failure of the potato crop in Ireland started a famine, a general lack of food in an area causing starvation. During the next 15 years, more than 1 million Irish came to the United States. Thousands of Germans also came between 1840 and 1860. Poor harvest, lack of land and jobs, and desire for political freedom caused them to leave Germany in search of a better life. Altogether, well over 4 million people came to the United States in the years from 1840 to 1860. Many industries actively recruited foreign labor to come to the United States. This British drawing is titled "The Lure of American Wages." What does it suggest about the benefits of working in America? 276 New Ways and New People 4.2 Settling in America. The experiences of the immigrants when they arrived in the United States followed certain patterns. For the most part, people from Germany arrived with some money. Many were able to move to areas where land was available, such as the Middle West. Large numbers of German immigrants settled on farms in Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin. Thousands of Germans also settled in cities, especially in the West. Many set up their own businesses. By 1860. nearly half of the population of both Milwaukee and St. Louis was of German descent. Germans made up 30 percent of the population of Cincinnati. When Irish immigrants landed in the United States, they generally did not have the money to buy farms or land. They often settled in eastern seaports, such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. In 1855, there were more than 50,000 Irish living in Boston. Nearly two thirds of the Irish immigrants to America settled in the northeast section of the country. Irish workers were important sources of labor around the country for the factories and for canal and railroad building. 4.3 The Nativist Movement. During the 1830's and 1840's, a movement against the immigrants began in America. Members of the group were known as Nativists because they were native to, or born in, the United States. Most were Protestants of British background. Nativists feared competition for jobs from immigrants who worked for low wages. Nativists also believed that the country was in danger from the large numbers of Catholics coming there to live. Because most Irish immigrants were Catholics, the movement was largely directed against them. There were violent clashes in several cities between Nativist poups and Irish immigrants. Nativists wanted only American-born Protestants to hold political office. They were against both foreigners and Catholics. In the 1850's, a national party was formed. When asked about opposition to immigrants, its members answered, "I know nothing." Because of this, they became known as the Know-Nothings. Under the name of the American party, the Know-Nothings participated in the election of 1856.They lost strength in the years after 1856. Issues like slavery began lo push the question of immigration into the background. 1. From where did most of the immigrants come during the years between 1820 and 1840? 2. Where did most of these people settle? 3. Which political party was formed in opposition to the immigrants? Why did most Irish settle in eastern cities? Why did a Nativist movement develop? New Ways and New People 277 5. Conclusion During the years from 1820 to 1860, the United States experienced a great deal of growth and change. Industry expanded with the introduction of power-driven machinery. Cities were established around newly-built factories. The coming of the railroad revolutionized transportation. Population increased as thousands of immigrants landed in the United States. By 1860, the "old" America had given way to a "new" America. Chapt er 12 Review Main Points________ 1.

Armand Lanusse was a famous poet, and inventions of Norbert Rillieux were of value to the sugar industry. As individuals, free white and black people often respected each other in New Orleans. Free blacks lived on the same city streets as whites. When they could afford it, they sent their children to private schools in America and France. As a group, however, the whites had almost all of the power and wealth. By the 1850's, more laws were passed to limit the rights of free blacks. The demand for cheap labor drew many immigrants to New Orleans. Many died on the way or of yellow fever once they arrived in New Orleans. Since it had become illegal to import slaves from West Africa, those slaves that were already in New Orleans were too valuable to do heavy work. The European immigrants, especially the Irish, were hired to do the heaviest jobs of draining canals, paving streets, and improving the levees. Northern visitors were often surprised by the way the people spent their Sundays. Bishop Whipple wrote in his journal: . . . this is the day of military parade and review ... a day of pomp and parade. . . . Shops were open and singing and guitar playing in the streets, for which in New York or Philadelphia one would be put in prison. Sunday was also a holiday for slaves in New Orleans. Many of them spent their time in Congo Square where they sang and danced in West African tradition. Some blacks in New Orleans continued to practice non-Chris- tian religions brought from Africa and the West Indies. Most blacks attended Christian churches, usually Catholic, sometimes Baptist and Methodist. The Catholic church services were attended by whites and blacks together. In other services, blacks usually were separated from whites. New Orleans also had a few churches that were only for blacks. The Young People Eliza Ripley wrote a book about her life in New Orleans. Her story has many examples of what it was like to grow up in that city. In 1842 there was a class in Spanish at Mr. Hennen's house. ... I was ten years old, but was allowed to join with some other members of my family, though my mother protested it was nonsense for a child like me and a waste of money.

What other nationalities made up the city's population, giving it an international flavor? 302 New Orleans People in the United States had won a victory in the Mexican War and had settled the Oregon question. They had fulfilled what they thought of as the manifest destiny of their country. However, adding new territories also brought problems. The possibility of several new states in the Union raised the question of whether or not these states would allow slavery. Leaders in the North felt that it should not be allowed. Southern leaders, on the other hand, supported the spread of slavery. The struggle between the North and South became bitter, and there was talk of disunion and civil war. 1. Sectional Differences Differences between the North and South did not begin or end with slavery. The two areas had been growing apart for more than 50 years. Social, economic, and political differences formed the background for the debate over slavery. 1.1 Social Differences. Different forms of social life had developed in the North and in the South. During colonial times, the sections shared certain social patterns. Most of the people were of British heritage, or background. They shared the same language, customs, and law. There were differences even then, however. In general, planters dominated social life in the South, while in the North, single group set the pattern of living. Education was more lidespread in the North than in the South. In the years before 1860, the North changed more than the South, indthe two areas became even less alike. The population of the North gew rapidly. Cities became important. Immigration brought a great variety of people to the northern states. The white population of the South grew slowly. Immigration into the South was also slow, and its impact was slight. The large number of black slaves in the South further sc; the two sections apart. 1.2 Economic Differences. The North and South also moved it different directions economically. In the early days of the United States, life in both parts of the country centered around farms and small tillages. The South remained an agricultural area and did not develop nich industry. Although most southern whites had small farms, the htttimportant part of the southern economy was the large plantations. Onthem, tobacco, rice, sugar cane, and cotton were grown, using slave iibor. Economic ideas changed slowly in the South. Southern leaders How did the North and South differ socially? How did the North and South differ economically? A Divided Nation 313 Frederick Douglass (1817-1895) In 1838, Frederick Douglass fled slavery in Tuckahoe, Maryland, for freedom in New Bedford, Massachusetts. In 1840, at a meeting of the Massachusetts Antislavery Society, Douglass told what freedom meant to him. He so impressed the abolitionists that they hired him to speak about his life as a slave. Douglass worked for the end of slavery and the end of unfair treatment of free black people everywhere. Douglass wrote his autobiography in 1845. Because of his growing fame, he was concerned that some people might try to send him back to slavery. So he went to Europe for two years. In England and Ireland, Douglass spoke to abolitionist groups. With enough money from his book to buy his freedom, Douglass returned to the United States, settling in Rochester, New York. Douglass continued to work for the antislavery movement by starting a newspaper, the North Star. And he continued to oppose the discrimination he and other black people faced. Douglass led attacks on separate seating for blacks and whites on trains and separate schools. He worked hard for equal rights for black people. Douglass was the leading supporter of liberty and justice for American black people in the 1800's. "re against it. Many, perhaps the majority, were prejudiced against Ms, both free blacks in the North and slaves in the South. Of the le who were against slavery, there were some who simply did not "ant it to spread into new territories or states. Others, the abolitionists, wanted an end to all slavery. Free blacks, such as Sojourner Truth and erick Douglass, went even further. They worked for equal tment of blacks in America. 2.5 Southern Response. The response of southern whites to amove to end slavery took several forms. At first, those people who red slavery were most upset by abolitionists. Southern leaders felt ihtt these people encouraged slaves to revolt. They tried to keep very speakers out of their states. Post office workers in the South not deliver mail about abolitionist ideas.

Tomost of the immigrants, it was also proof of loyalty to their new country. Through religious, social, and government organizations, the people of the city i played an important part in the war. They I raised money for special payments to those who volunteered to join the army. They aged for improved health care and lanitary conditions in the distant army camps. By the spring of 1862, people realized that "the show time of the war has passed away, and it has become a matter of sober business.

Young People The daily lives of the younger people in the city changed little during the war years. Most of them kept up their studies, and Dicey was very impressed by the schools they attended.

The Cost of Living By the summer of 1863, the slow and deadly progress of the war had changed life for many of the city's people. Some of those in business became very rich from war trade. But the pay of ordinary soldiers was quickly spent by families as the cost of living increased. Taxes rose, rents went up, and food became very expensive. Even the lowest-paying jobs became very important to the city's immigrants who held New York 377 most of them. The Emancipation Proclamation had upset many workers, especially the Irish who had most of the unskilled, low-pay- ing jobs. These people were afraid that freed blacks would come north to find work. Many of the workers had been the first to volunteer to fight for the Union. They were not so willing, however, to fight for the freedom of slaves. The Draft Riot Some political leaders and news writers in the city did not agree with the way President Lincoln ran the war. In 1863, they especially attacked the order to draft soldiers. The first list of drafted men was published on Sunday, July 12. It was made up mostly of poor people; many of them also supported the Democratic party. Some Democratic party leaders had To protest the Conscription Act of 1863, some people in New York set fire to a building storing draft records. Why did people challenge the draft law? claimed that it was unconstitutional for the government to force a state citizen to serve in a federal army. They charged that the number of Democrats on the draft list was too high. Monday morning, a large crowd of people gathered in front of the draft office. Some of them believed that men had been drafted for political reasons. Others were afraid of losing their jobs to blacks. Many were tired of high prices and low pay. By Monday afternoon, the crowd had changed into a violent mob. Men, women, and some children began to attack the draft office. They set fire to the records, books, and furniture. They beat the people who tried to stop them. From the draft office, the mob went to attack the shops and homes of antislavery leaders. They caught black people on the street and beat them, sometimes killing them. A home for black orphans was burned to the ground, and one child died in the fire. After four days, the riot was finally ended with the help of federal and state soldiers and special groups of volunteer citizens. Many people had lost their lives, and over S1.5 million worth of property had been destroyed. Joy and Sorrow In some sections of New York, many people were making a great deal of money from the war. They enjoyed spending it. New theaters opened, and large new houses were built. Richly dressed men and women rode in expensive carriages along Fifth Avenue to Central Park. George Templeton Strong, who lived on Manhattan all his life, recorded some of the events of April 1865 in his diary. Strong was walking down Wall Street on April 3 when the news came that Richmond had been captured by Union troops. 378 New York The United States entered a period of great change after the Civil War. Large numbers of Americans moved to settle certain areas of the West for the first time. Many people, in the years between 1860 and 1890, experienced changes in their ways of life. The population of the country itself was also changing, as a new era of immigration brought millions of people to the United States. 1. Settlers on the Frontier Huge new territories had been added to the United States during the 1840's. Some Americans already lived in those areas—that is, in California, Oregon, Texas, and other parts of the Far West. However, the frontier generally ran from Minnesota through Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, and eastern Texas. Between this line and the Far West was a large area of land which included the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, and the Great Basin. In the years after the Civil War, more and more people moved into this area. 1.1 The Mining Frontier. New discoveries of gold and silver brought miners to the western frontier. A small mining boom occurred jiColorado in 1859. Other finds in that area over the next 30 years supplied new sources of mineral wealth. A huge deposit of silver, known as the Comstock Lode, drew miners to Nevada in 1859. Idaho became a center of mining activity in the 1860's. Between 1862 and 1868, discoveries were made in Montana. Mining also became unpottant in New Mexico, Arizona, and the Black Hills of South Dakota. Settlement of the mining frontier most often followed a pattern, kindreds, sometimes thousands, of miners moved into an area and made claims. A mining camp was set up, from which a small town grew. Once a deposit was mined out, the town was often abandoned as the miners went to look for new claims. The empty, lifeless towns the miners left behind became known as ghost towns. Gold and silver caused added interest in the West. Each find brought settlers, as well as miners, to the area. Many of them set up larms or started businesses. Important cities—such as Boise, Idaho; Helena, Montana; and Virginia City, Nevada—grew up near the mines, ^addition, the precious metals from the West increased the wealth of the United States. After the Civil War, what area was considered the frontier? What was the pattern of mining settlement?

What changes began to occur in immigration patterns in the 1880's? 4. A Growing and Changing Population_________________________________ The population of America was also going through great changes in the early 1900's. In 1860, there were 31.5 million people in the United States. By 1900, the population had grown to 76 million people. A large part of this came from immigration. Between 1860 and 1900, 14 million immigrants entered the country. They brought their customs, languages, and religions to an already changing nation. 4.1 The "Old" Immigration. In the late 1800's, most immigrants who entered the United States were still coming from northwestern Europe. This movement was known as the "old" immigration, because these people came from the same areas as earlier immigrants. The largest group—nearly 3.5 million—came from Germany. Almost 2 million people arrived from Great Britain and nearly the same number from Ireland. Around 1.4 million people came from the Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Nearly 500,000 of them settled in the Middle West. 4.2 The "New" Immigration. Beginning around 1880, patterns of immigration began to change. More and more people entered the country from southern and eastern Europe. This movement was known as the "new" immigration, because up to that time few people from these areas had come to the United States. Between 1880 and 1900, about 100,000 "new" immigrants came to the United States each year. From 1900 to 1914, the numbers generally reached 500,000 a year. Nearly 3 million Italians arrived in the United States between 1900 and 1914. During the same period, 3 million people from Austria- Hungary and almost 2.5 million people from Russia and the Baltic countries of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia came to America. Another 500,000 people entered the United States from the Balkan countries of Rumania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. Included in these groups were a large number of Poles. Large numbers of "new" immigrants moved into the cities of the northeastern United States. They often sought jobs that had been 402 A Changing Nation Pluralism From colonial times, the American population has been made up of various nationalities, races, and religions. The people who came to America tried to .maintain their old world traditions while living in American society. Because of this, America became characterized by pluralism—several independent ethnic groups within a common society. Despite the accepted idea of a pluralistic America, some Americans in the late 1800's felt that some immigrants would hurt the United States as a whole. There were hostile reactions to certain newcomers. A mood of fear led to many laws aimed at controlling immigration to the United States. In 18%, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts argued for a bill to establish a literacy test. The bill was designed to exclude all immigrants who could not read or write 25 words of the Constitution in any language. It is found, in the first place, that the illiteracy test will bear most heavily upon the Italians, Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks, and Asiatics, and very lightly, or not at all, upon English-speaking emigrants or Germans, Scandinavians, and French. In other words, the races most affected by the illiteracy test are those whose emigration to this country has begun within the last twenty years and swelled rapidly to enormous proportions, races with which the English-speaking people have never hitherto assimilated, and who are most alien to the great body of the people of the United States. President Grover Cleveland disagreed with Lodge's view and vetoed the bill. It is said . . . that the quality of recent immigration is undesirable. The time is quite within recent memory when the same thing was said of immigrants who, with their descendants are now numbered among our best citizens. . . . In my opinion, it is .. . safe to admit. . . immigrants who, though unable to read or write, seek among us only a home and opportunity for work. . . . 1.

Others worked in the coal mines or in the garment industry. They tended to live among people from their own country who shared a common religion, customs, and language. 4.3 Asian Immigration. The first large group of people from China entered the United States in 1849 during the California gold rush. In the 1860's, Chinese workers played an important part in building the Central Pacific Railroad. More Chinese came in the 1870's. Many moved into the mining areas of the West. Some set up businesses in California, Nevada, and other western states. Even though Chinese immigration increased after 1860, only 300,000 Chinese entered the United States between 1820 and 1882. 404 A Changing Nation Some years later, people from Japan began entering the United States. They settled on the Pacific coast, mainly in California. Although some bought their own land, most took jobs as farm workers. By 1910, wound 155,000 Japanese were living in the United States. 4.4 Reaction to Immigration. Many people born in the United States became alarmed at the large numbers of immigrants entering the country. They were disturbed because many of the immigrants had little education. Some Americans felt that because of this, these people could not take part in democracy. They also feared that the newcomers would take the jobs of American workers. In the East, there was reaction against people from southern and eastern Europe. Some people in the East did not like the fact that many ofthe immigrants were Catholic or Jewish. In the West, there had been [opposition to Asian immigrants for some time. Their language, [appearance, and customs were unfamiliar to most Americans. In the late 1880's, a number of secret societies against immigrants were formed. Most were also against Catholics and Jews. One of the most important was the American Protective Association, started in 1887. Groups like this called for restrictions on immigration. 4.5 Regulation of Immigration. In certain areas of the West, | local laws were passed against the Chinese. Chinese could not hold I certain jobs or marry whites. They were usually forced to live in certain of cities. As feelings against the Chinese grew, the federal ivernment passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, the country's first law at controlling immigration. Why was there concern about immigration in the late 1800's? What was the American Protective Association? This cartoon was drawn by Joseph Keppler for his humor magazine Puck. It shows Uncle Sam welcoming people two by two from many countries onto his ark. Immigrants were welcomed for cheap labor by employers. Yet the newcomers were resented for working for low pay by many American workers. What special problems faced immigrants?

How did immigration change for each decade between 1861 and 1920? For each decade, where were most immigrants born? What were the provisions of the Chinese Exclusion Act? How were the Japanese immigrants made to feel prejudice? Passed in 1882, this act said that no Chinese worker could enter the country for the next ten years. This period was later extended. Nearly all of the Chinese wishing to enter the United States were workers. So the law stopped almost all Chinese from coming to America for some years. The law also said that the courts could no longer make Chinese people citizens of the United States. Two months later. Congress passed an act which restricted immigration in general. It said that criminals, people with mental illnesses, and people with no money or jobs could not enter the United States. The prejudice against Asians also was felt by the Japanese when they began entering the United States. They, too, were forced to live in certain areas. Local laws kept them from owning land. The federal government also tried to limit or to stop Japanese immigration through agreements with the government of Japan. In one of these, the San Francisco school board said it would end the policy of separate schools for Asian children. In return, the Japanese government said it would limit immigration to the United States. 1. From what countries did the "old" immigrants come? 2. From what countries did the "new" immigrants come? 3.

The process of industrialization, which had begun in the 1820's and 1830's, speeded up after the Civil War. The number and size of businesses increased. By 1900, certain large industries were so important to the American economy that this period became known as the "Age of Big Business." 1. Background to Industrial Growth What natural resources were important in the growth of Big Business? Where was the first successful oil well drilled? Where are the largest iron ore deposits in the country? There were several things which made the growth of Big Business possible in the late 1800's. Some of them had been present in the early days of the United States. Others came with the changes taking place in American life. 1.1 Natural Resources. The United States had an abundance of natural resources. Some of them were needed for industrial growth. Coal, which was used as fuel to power steam engines in factories, was especially important. Large deposits were found in Pennsylvania. Wes: Virginia. Kentucky, Ohio, and several other states. Other resources also aided the growth of industry in the late 1800V Oil was used to lubricate machines and as a fuel for lamps. In 1859. Edwin Drake drilled the first successful oil well near Titusville, Pennsylvania. Before long, drilling began in Ohio and West Virginia. In 1865, over 2 million barrels of oil were produced. Huge deposits of iron ore were found in upper Michigan as early as the 1840's. In 1855, the Soo canals opened. They made it possible for ships to pass between Lake Superior and Lake Huron. Iron ore then could be shipped through the Great Lakes to steel mills around Pittsburgh. Even larger deposits of iron ore were found in the Mesabi Range of Minnesota. This area was soon providing over one half of the country's supply of iron ore. 1.2 The Labor Supply. Another resource necessary to the growth of Big Business was labor. Between 1860 and 1900, the population of the United States grew rapidly. Because of this, the number of people seeking jobs grew as well. Former slaves were among those who joined the free labor market. In the late 1800's, some southern blacks began to seek jobs in cities. Immigrants were another source of labor during these yean Between 1860 and 1900, 14 million people came to the United States 410 The Age of Big Business Who were some important settlement house founders? What were some important works that urged reform? medical care and to get help in finding jobs. Immigrants could go to learn English. The first settlement house was established in London. England, in 1884. In the United States, the first settlement house was set up in New York City in 1886. Settlement houses were also founded in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, and other large cities. One of the most famous settlement houses was Chicago's Hull House. It was started by Jane Addams in 1889. Jane Edna Hunter, a black nurse from South Carolina, set up the Working Girls' Home Association in Cleveland, Ohio. It was founded to help black women find jobs in the city. Lillian Wald started Henry Street Settlement in New York. Wald was especially interested in providing free nursing care for the needy. 6.3 The Literature of Protest. A number of authors during these years wrote works that urged reform. Henry George's Progress and Poverty came out in 1879. George wanted a single tax levied on those who owned land. George believed this would narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward, printed in 1888, described a utopian America in the year 2000. In this society, profit making had been set aside, and wealth was shared by all. Jacob Riis did a study of life in the slums, How the Other Half Lives, in 1890. It showed a number of photographs Riis had taken in New York City. Slum life was also described in Stephen Crane's Maggie: A Girl of the Streets. Wealth Against Commonwealth by Henry Demarest Lloyd directly attacked the Standard Oil trust. All of these writings drew people's attention to the problems caused by Big Business. 1. What was the settlement house movement? 2. Who wrote about problems caused by business in the late 1800's? 7. Conclusion__________________________________________ The United States became the world's leading industrial nation during the "Age of Big Business." The rise of Big Business, however, created a new set of problems for Americans. By the end of the 1800's, opinion was divided about the economy. Supporters of laissez-faire believed that the economic system worked best when left alone. They also believed that the system was, for the most part, fair. Farmers, workers, and others believed that rules were needed to control Big Business and ensure justice for everyone. As the new century began, Americans continued the search for answers to the questions raised by these issues. The Age of Big Business By the end of the 1800's, new and growing industries were bringing the American people more opportunities than ever before. Many Americans, however, searched for answers to the problems caused by industrialization. In the early 1900's, a wave of reform swept the United States. Because of the number of reforms made during these years, the period became known as the Progressive Era. To what extent did urban growth take place in the late 7800's? What were the sources of urban growth? What things helped foster a growth in education in the late 1800's? 1. New Opportunities________________________________________ The rise of industry led to the growth of cities. Many people moved to these cities looking for a chance to improve their lives. There they often found jobs, a better opportunity for education, and new ways to enjoy themselves. 1.1 Toward an Urban America. After the Civil War, cities in the United States grew both in number and in size. Between 1860and 1910, the urban population of the United States grew from a little over6 million to over 40 million. In 1860, 20 percent of all Americans lived in cities with 2,500 or more people. By 1910, 46 percent of all Americans lived in such places. In 1860, there were only 16 cities in the United States with a population over 50,000. By 1910, there were 109. This growth came from different sources. Many Americans left their farms for city life. They came to work in the new offices and factories. During the late 1800's and early 1900's, some southern blacks began moving to cities to find better jobs. At the same time, immigrants in search of a better life settled in the cities of the Northeast and Middle West. 1.2 Growing Educational Opportunities. As the economy grew, so did interest in public education. In the 1870's, some states passed compulsory attendance laws. These laws required that children attend school for a certain part of the year. By 1900,30 states had passed such laws. More people became interested in higher education during the late 1800's. One of the reasons for this was the Morrill Act, passed in 1862. Under this act, states were given public lands to set up state colleges of engineering, teacher training, and agriculture. Meanwhile, the total number of colleges grew from about 500 in 1870 to nearly 1,000 in 1900. During these years, educational opportunities increased for both women and blacks. By 1900, blacks had founded over 30 colleges, mostly in the South. Over 2,000 black students had graduated. By 1900, nearly 100,000 women were attending college. 432 The Progressive Era Jane Addams (1860-1935) At age 29, Jane Addams took over the shabby Hull mansion in Chicago's tenement district. In 1889, she opened its doors to the poor and oppressed of the city. She renamed the mansion Hull House. By 1900, Addams provided social services to 2,000 people each day, offering recreation, entertainment, job training, and education. Addams was raised in Illinois. Early in her life, she was determined to improve the world's way of living. Hull House was her way of beginning. It also served as a model for many more people who felt they could best help other people by working and living with them. Besides Hull House, Addams found other ways to improve the world. She fought for legal protection of immigrants, for the regulation of child labor, and for women's suffrage. During World War I, she was the central figure in the international women's peace movement. In 1931, she shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Nicholas Murray Butler, president of Columbia University. Typically, Addams directed that her share of the prize money be used to help create a better life for all of humankind. = What was the major issue of the election of 1896? What effect did being on the gold standard have on money? A number of issues divided the reformers and the supporters of Big Business. The most important issue, however, was the money question. In 1873, the United States had gone on the gold standard. This meant that paper money was backed by gold alone. Since gold was scarce, this reduced the amount of money in use and hurt farmers. They wanted paper money to be backed by silver as well as gold, a policy known as bimetalism. Money backed by both metals would have brought about inflation, or an increased money supply with a resulting rise in prices. Farmers then would have been able to pay off their debts more easily. Silver miners and their representatives in Congress backed the farmers. Those who favored the gold standard, on the other hand, believed that if the government used both silver and gold to back money, gold would drop in value. This, in turn, would weaken business and the economy. 436 The Progressive Era What was the Republican position in the election of 1896? What helped to bring about an end to the Populist party? Who were the reformers of the early 1900's? 438 The Progressive over the Populist party's platform. So the Populists also chose Bryan, thinking that he had the best chance to win. With the Democrats and Populists supporting bimetalism, the Republicans came out for the gold standard and a higher protective tariff. They selected William McKinley of Ohio as their candidate. McKinley won in 1896 with 271 electoral votes to Bryan's 176. During McKinley's term in office, the economy began to improve. Crop failures in Europe caused farm prices to rise. New gold found in Alaska made it possible to add to the country's gold reserves. This meant that the government could increase the money supply without minting silver. All of these changes helped to bring about an end to the Populist party. 1. What was the purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act? 2. How successful was the Sherman Antitrust Act? 3. Who wanted to increase the amount of money in use? Why? 3. The Beginnings of Progressivism--------------------------------- Shortly after the decline of the Populists, a new wave of reform swept the country. The reformers believed that their ideas would lead to progress and a better way of life for more Americans. Because of this, these people were called progressives. Although they drew support from some of the same groups as the Populists, there were differences Progressivism, unlike populism, was centered in America's cities. Its leaders were doctors, lawyers, teachers, and owners of small businesses, rather than farmers. 3.1 Progressive Aims. The progressives did not have an organized group and often differed in their aims. Most progressives shared certain ideas, however. They wanted honest government, with power in the hands of the people. They wanted an active government, which would regulate Big Business. They also favored social reforms that would make life better for people. They worked to improve labor conditions for women, children, and other workers. The progressive aims, however, did not include improving rights for minority groups Life for blacks, Indians, and Mexican Americans grew worse in some ways in this period. 3.2 Progressive Literature. In the early 1900's, certain writers pointed out the need for reform by pointing out corruption in Era ■ ~ Chicago 453 Gustavus Swift, owner of one meatpacking company, shipped frozen beef east during the winter. In 1879, he came up with a way to ship frozen meat east all year long. Swift used a new railroad car called the Tiffany Refrigerator Car. Frozen beef became so popular that all the other packing companies began to use refrigerated cars, too. Shipment of meat increased from S65 million in 1870 to over $500 million in 1890. The Heart of Chicago Tens of thousands of people came to I Chicago during the late 1800's. They included thousands of immigrants from Germany, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and many other countries. Black people moved there from southern states. The newcomers seldom found things as they had hoped. Jobs were hard to get. Work was not steady, and many people had to do jobs they had never done before. Pay was very low for working days that were sometimes 10 to 16 hours long. Women and children often had to work in sweatshops to help their families live. These shops were usually found in the run-down tenement buildings surrounding the business districts. The bad lighting, lack of fresh air, and poor plumbing made working there very difficult. Some girls, 10 to 15 years old, Hie Chicago fire of 1871 burned nearly 2.000 acres of the city. After it was destroyed. I Chicago was rebuilt in a manner similar to other modern cities. What improvements were made in the second building of Chicago? worked in clothes sweatshops. They averaged 50 cents a week for sewing on buttons or pulling out threads. If they did those jobs well, they sometimes moved up to sewing articles by hand and earned $2 or $2.50 a week as the older women did. Boys of the same age generally had jobs as messengers or errand runners. Holding the same job for many years did not guarantee that a worker would keep that job. Mary McDowell wrote: One of my best friends was a German cattle butcher who began work at eleven years of age on the "killing floor," where he worked for twenty-five years until his right arm began to shake from the constant [use] of a huge cleaver, more like a battle axe. Workers butcher beef in a Chicago meat-packing plant. What factors contributed to Chicago becoming a major meat-packing center? . . . after going twenty-five years on a "killing bed, " where he had been one of the few skilled workers, receiving forty-five cents an hour, he [was] suddenly [fired] without any reason given by the boss, except that his right arm was shaking and that he was unable to keep up with the "pace maker," [leader] who was a giant. . . . "I understand now," he said, "why men are not sure of a job always, and why they organize, for at thirty-five I have reached my old age limit." Housing was a serious problem. Most immigrants lived close to the business districts. The buildings in these districts were not kept in very good condition. The only water for some came from a pump in the yard. Garbage and waste matter often sat in the alleys behind the buildings. Still, owners charged high rents. Sometimes several families lived together in one room to help pay the rent. Others took in boarders. A Helping Hand There were people in Chicago who cared about the problems of the poor. Mary McDowell lived and worked in a settlement house there in the late 1880's. She wrote: . . . the Settlement home was upstairs over a Day Nursery; every morning when it was barely light in the winter, / would be wakened by the cry of the little children who wanted the mother to stay at home and not go to work Here again for the first time in my life l saw the meaning of the job and how wage-earning women had to carry two burdens—that of the home and that of the wage-earning world. In that day there was no child-labor law and the packing industry found useful the boys and girls of eleven years of age, and men and women and children had no limit to their day's work. 454 Chicago Jmc Addams learned about settlement house work I taring a visit to London in 1888. What was the name of the settlement house Addams opened in Chicago? Jane Addams rented a mansion in the middle of the tenement section of Chicago in 1889. She named it Hull House and opened its doors to the neighborhood. At Hull House, immigrants could learn to speak English and other job skills. The efforts of Jane Addams to help the newcomers did not stop at Hull House. She had a great respect for the immigrants and joined many groups to help change living conditions. She told of a Greek fruit seller and Ml impression of the people of Chicago: hr three years, in Greece, while he was saving I money to come to America, he used to make imwings of ancient Athens, of which he was very fond. He was a graduate of the Institute of Technology [in Greece], and drew very well. He had collected a large book of drawings and photographs. He thought that when he came to America, where we had no ruins, that we would be interested to hear about them. . . . He said he had sold fruit to Americans for years in Chicago, and that although he often had tried to lead the conversation to his beloved Acropolis [an ancient ruin in Athens], no one had ever seemed interested. He came to the conclusion no one in Chicago had heard of ancient Greece, nor knew that it had a wonderful history. . . . That man was disappointed and Chicago was losing something he could have given to it. I did not like to tell him we had become so snobbish in America that it did not occur to [us] that a shabby-looking foreigner selling apples could have his mind and heart full of the deathless beauties of ancient Greece. . . . The World's Fair Many of the social problems that were affecting Chicago were also affecting the country as a whole. However, people in Chicago spent two years enjoying something special—the World's Fair. On February 24, 1890, the United States Congress selected Chicago as the site for the World's Columbian Exposition to be held in 1893. Its purpose was to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' landing in America. Daniel Burnham was the chief architect of the fair. It was his decision to have all the buildings painted white, giving Chicago the nickname "The White City." The fair had 50 foreign nations and 37 colonies participating as well as every state in the country. The fairgrounds were located in Jackson Park and Washington Park on a total Chicago 455 The United States has been an expanding nation throughout much of its history. Manifest destiny carried the American people from the eastern seaboard to the Pacific. In the late 1800's, the United States became interested in a new kind of expansion. It began to acquire lands across the seas. This was a new manifest destiny. And because of it, the United States had to change the way it looked at foreign affairs. 1. The Stirrings of Expansion_____________________________________________ Until the 1880's and 1890's, the American people paid attention mostly to what was going on at home. Americans were living through the changes of industrialization. They were fighting a civil war and settling the frontier areas of the West. They showed little interest in other lands. But by the end of the 1800's, Americans were looking overseas. Soon most were willing to go along with their government's involvement in the affairs of other countries. 1.1 Early Attempts. Americans had begun trading with other areas of the world long before the Civil War. In 1844, Caleb Cushing became the first American commissioner to China. Several years earlier, there had been a war between Great Britain and China. The British had made the Chinese open several ports to British trade. Cushing worked out a trade agreement with the Chinese to open the same ports to American ships. Japan, on the other hand, had kept its ports closed to Western trade. The Japanese finally opened one port, Nagasaki, to the Spanish, Portuguese, and Dutch. The Americans, however, wanted to trade with Japan, too. In 1853, a fleet of American warships under Commodore Matthew Perry sailed to Japan. Perry convinced the Japanese ruler to open several ports to the United States the following year. An early supporter of American expansion overseas was William Seward, President Andrew Johnson's Secretary of State. At the time, Alaska was owned by Russia. In 1867, Seward convinced the United States government to buy Alaska from the Russians for $7.2 million. That same year, the United States also annexed Midway Island, in the Pacific west of Hawaii. 1.2 Expansionist Ideas. By the late 1880's, most of the totalized countries of the world were looking for new markets for their goods. They also wanted new sources of such raw materials as oil, tin. rubber, and cotton. For these and other reasons, European Why did Americans pay little attention to foreign affairs during much of the 1800's? How did the United States obtain trading rights in China? Who opened up Japan to trade? A New Manifest Destiny 463 Who led the revolt by the Filipinos? Who headed the first civilian government? defeated. Many Americans also favored independence for the islands. But President McKinley felt the United States should keep control. When the Filipinos found out that they were not going to become independent, they revolted against American rule. The Filipinos were led by Emilio Aguinaldo who had earlier helped the Americans defeat the Spaniards. The Americans brought in more soldiers to hold off the Filipinos. In 1901, Aguinaldo was captured, and his revolution ended. On July 4 of that year, the President named Judge William Howard Taft to be the first civil governor of the Philippines. Taft had headed a commission that had studied the situation in the islands. It had reported on how to set up a civil government there. The President also selected several Americans to serve in the upper house of the island legislature. The Filipinos elected the members to the lower house. What was a sphere of influence? Who first wanted equal trade rights in China? What was Hay's Open Door policy? What was the Boxer Rebellion? 3.2 China and the Open Door. One reason the United States wanted to keep the Philippines was to have territory close to China. China was rich in natural resources. Its large population offered a good market for American goods. Constant fighting among different groups of Chinese had made the Chinese government weak. It was not strong enough to keep other countries out of China. Great Britain, Germany. Russia, Japan, and France claimed parts of China as their own spheres of influence, or areas of control over trade. Each country had special trading rights in its spheres and tried to keep others from trading there. American business people were afraid they might lose out on the China trade. At the same time, the British were concerned about how strong the Japanese were becoming in China. They wanted the United States to get all countries to agree to equal trading rights in China. In 1899, Secretary of State John Hay sent messages to the major European countries and Japan. In these notes. Hay spoke of an Open Door policy in China. Hay wanted the countries to agree to keep Chinese ports open to all. He wanted them to guarantee equal railroad, harbor, and tariff rates for all. He also wanted them to allow the Chinese government to collect duties on all goods coming into and going out of China. Most of the countries hesitated to accept the plan. This did not stop Hay. In March 1900, when no countries had disagreed, Hay announced that all the powers had agreed to the Open Door. Many Chinese did not like the changes foreign trade had brought to their country. They wanted all outsiders to leave China. Members of a Chinese secret society, which Westerners called the Boxers, led an effort to remove foreigners from the country. In 1900, they attacked foreigners living in the city of Peking. The siege lasted for eight weeks. American, British, German, Russian, Japanese, and French troops joined to rescue their people in Peking and put an end to the attack. 472 A New Manifest Destiny In the middle 1800's, foreign flags flew over the port of Canton. They showed the number of Western nations trading with China. Which countries do these flags represent? What was expressed in the second Open Door note? Why was Japan important to the Open Door policy? Who played a role in settling the Russo-Japanese War? The United States was afraid that the other countries would use the Boxer Rebellion as an excuse to divide up China. In July 1900, the United States issued a second Open Door note. It stated that America would preserve the land and government of China as one nation. It also said that America would continue to support the idea of equal trade with China for all countries of the world. 3.3 Relations With Japan. Japan was important to the Open Door policy. Soon after the Japanese opened their country to trade in 1854, they began to industrialize and modernize their economy. By the early 1900's, Japan was one of the leading powers of the world. It had carved a sphere of influence out of China and had gained control of Korea. The Japanese also were interested in Manchuria, an area in northeastern China. But the Russians also wanted to control the area, and conflict arose. The United States was afraid that if either country gained too much influence, the Open Door policy would be in danger. In 1904, war broke out between Japan and Russia. By 1905, the Japanese clearly were winning the war. To bring about peace, President Roosevelt offered to hold talks between the two countries. Both sides agreed, and in August 1905, they met with him in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Roosevelt later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. But the Japanese were not happy with the peace terms. They did not feel that they had received the cash and land they deserved from their victories over the Russians. While the peace talks were going on, the United States and Japan worked out the Taft-Katsura Agreement of 1905. In it, the United 474 A New Manifest Destiny States agreed to recognize Japanese control of Korea. Japan agreed to make no move toward the Philippines. But relations between the United States and Japan were not good. Over the next few years, relations grew worse. The United States and Japan feared each other's power in Asian affairs. 1. Why did the United States keep control of the Philippines after the Spanish-American War? 2. Which countries were interested in trade with China? 3. What caused war between Japan and Russia in 1904? 4. United States in Latin America When the United States won the Spanish-American War, it gained ssions not only in the Pacific, but in the Caribbean as well. American interest in the Caribbean had been growing before the war. After the war, the United States became the main power in the area. 4.1 Governing Puerto Rico. In 1900, the United States passed theForaker Act. This act set up a government in Puerto Rico much like the one in the Philippines. A governor and 11 members of an executive council were to be selected by the President. Five of the council rmbers had to be Puerto Ricans. The council would serve as the upper house of the legislature. The lower house would be elected by the people of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rican reaction to rule by the United States was mixed. Leaders like Betances were against it. But many business people were in favor of it. Under American rule, a great deal more sugar was grown for ihe American market. More farmland was bought by large sugar nies. This left less land for the small farmers. Many of them ted Puerto Rico to be independent. 4.2 American Interest in Cuba. After the United States had helped to free Cuba from Spain, the Americans kept an active interest rathe island's affairs. The United States government wanted to protect rican investments there. It also wanted to make sure that no other try gained influence in Cuba. In 1900, the Cubans held a convention to write a constitution for atir country. In March of the following year. Congress passed the Platt mendment. It was part of a bill that provided money for the operation ithearmy. The Platt Amendment said that Cuba had to agree to sell or atsf (rent) land to the United States for naval bases. Cuba also had to What was the Foraker Act? What was the Platt Amendment? A New Manifest Destiny 475 What agencies were set up to regulate the economy? Who headed the Food Administration? What was Wilson's son-in-law's post? What Americans moved to the cities of the North and Middle West during the war? Why? What effect did the war have on women? 4.1 Wartime Industry and Agriculture. The United States had to make sure that the country met the needs of the military. To do this, the federal government set up agencies to regulate the country's economy. A War Industries Board was created in July 1917. The board was headed by Bernard Baruch. It had the power to fix prices, set standards, make sure of raw materials, and decide what goods should be produced first. In August 1917, Congress passed the Lever Food and Fuel Act, which set up a Food Administration and a Fuel Administration. The Food Administration was headed by Herbert Hoover. Its jobs were to stop the waste of food and to make sure that more food was produced. The agency asked Americans not to eat meat on certain days of the week. In this way, there would be more meat to send to the Allies. It also set the price of wheat. Because farmers were pleased with the price, they began to grow more wheat than they had in the past. The Fuel Administration was headed by Harry Garfield. Its jobs were to find ways to save and to produce more electricity. In December 1917, the federal government took over the railroads. Congress set up the United States Railroad Administration (USRA). Under the direction of William Gibbs McAdoo, the Secretary of the Treasury and President Wilson's son-in-law, the USRA controlled the track operated by close to 3,000 railway companies. It ran the railroads as a single system. 4.2 Wartime Labor and Immigration. Thousands of Americans left their jobs to join the military. Large numbers of people began to leave their homes in one part of the country to seek better jobs. Among these were many blacks and Mexican Americans. Thousands of blacks left the rural South to find work in the North. There they worked in steel mills, coal mines, meat-packing plants, and other industries. More than 12,000 blacks found jobs with the Pennsylvania Railroad. Mexican Americans from the Southwest moved to cities in the Middle West. They found work in mills, mines, and factories there. By 1920, nearly 70,000 Mexican Americans were living east of the Mississippi River, and ten times that many lived in the western states. Women became an important part of the American work force. Between 1915 and 1918, more than 1 million took jobs outside their homes. They worked in factories doing jobs that had been done by men. They also worked in new industries that had opened just to make military supplies. Women who had been working in business and industry before the war had a chance to move into better jobs which, for the most part, had been held by men. 494 A World at War The need to produce more also affected immigration. When the war began in Europe, fewer Europeans came into the United States than had in past years. In 1917, new laws were passed which cut down the number of immigrants even more. The new laws stated that immigrants over the age of 16 had to be able to read. Persons from a special "barred zone," which included India, Siam, and Indochina, were not allowed to enter the country as immigrants. But as the war dragged on and more Americans left the country to fight, America's need for workers grew. Food growers in the West asked Congress to allow all the farm workers who wanted to enter the country to do so. Growers hired Filipinos to work their fields in Hawaii. Mexicans were put to work in fields in California and other places. 4.3 Financing the War. It cost a great deal of money to fight World War I. The United States government had to find a way to raise What types of workers immigrated to the United States during the war? Many Americans played an active part in World War I. Some people on the home front worked in munition plants (left). A poster (right) reminded Americans to conserve for the war effort. How was the national economy affected by the war? The coal you are going without is forging the key to A World at War 495 Conference, the United States and Japan had signed several treaties. One concerned a small Pacific area called Yap Island. It was an important terminal for communications cables across the ocean. Japan had taken the island from Germany during World War I. In the treaty, the United States agreed to honor Japanese control of the island, and Japan agreed to allow the United States cable rights. Two other treaties were signed by Great Britain and France as well | as by the United States and Japan. In these, the four powers agreed to respect each other's rights in the Pacific. They also said they would meet to settle any disputes that might arise there. The United States and Japan, along with the other seven powers that had met in Washington, also signed the Nine-Power Pact. In it, all agreed to observe the Open Door policy in China. These treaties helped better relations between the United States and Japan. At the same time, however, they caused some problems. Japan did not like the fact that the Five-Power Pact did not allow it as treat a tonnage of ships as the pact did the United States and Great Britain. Japanese military leaders felt that their navy should be the equal of any navy in the world. Then, too, the Japanese felt that many Americans were prejudiced nst people of Japanese background in the United States. At the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, Japan had wanted to pass a resolution have it become part of the final peace treaty. The Japanese Herbert Hoover took a pre-inaugural tour of Central and South America to improve the image of the United States. What was the Hoover administration's Latin America policy?

President Wilson had helped block the resolution. He said the Senate would not approve any treaty that contained it. The Japanese did not forget this. They saw it as a sign of American prejudice. 1. What agreements did the United States sign to limit the world's arms production? 2. What agreement outlawed war? 3. What was the purpose of the Havana Conference? 2. Intolerance and Civil Rights________________________________________ World War I made some Americans want to avoid war above almost everything else. It also made some Americans intolerant—not willing to respect the beliefs, practices, or behavior of others. During the 1920's, this feeling was directed at several different groups. 2.1 The Red Scare. Part of the intolerance of the 1920's grew out of a fear of communism. Communists believe that through their government, the people own all property. There is no private ownership. The government, however, is supposed to meet the needs of all the people equally. Where the Communist party controls the government, it does not allow other political parties to exist. Communists believe that because the people share everything equally, they no longer will have to compete with one another. This, in turn, means that there will be no problems brought on by competition. In 1917, the Bolsheviks under Lenin overthrew the government of Russia and set up a Communist state. Since one of the goals of communism is to spread the system around the world, Americans began to fear that communism would spread to the United States. Because Communists were known as "reds" this became known as the red scan. In 1919, a Communist party was formed in the United States. Some Americans felt that something had to be done. One such American was A. Mitchell Palmer, Attorney General of the United States. Under his direction, the Department of Justice went after people suspected of being disloyal to the United States. This included anyone thought to be a Communist. It also included many who spoke out for labor reform or any other unpopular idea. In many cities, the police raided places where they thought these people could be found. By early 1920, some 4,000 to 6,000 people had been rounded up and jailed. About 500 aliens were deported. Others 520 Life in the Twenties were tried and convicted under state laws that forbade the support of certain unpopular ideas or the overthrow of the government. 2.2 From Fear to Intolerance. The fear of communism helped bring about a general fear of anything or anyone foreign or different. Because of this, much of the red scare was directed against aliens and new immigrants. Some Americans felt that these people were spreading ideas that could harm the American way of life. On May 5,1920, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who had recently come to the United States, were an-ested. They were charged with a payroll robbery and murder. On July 14, 1921, Sacco and Vanzetti were convicted and sentenced to death. Their trial, however, led to debate in the United States and other places. Sacco and Vanzetti were anarchists. Many people felt that this was the reason they had been convicted. Others, however, felt they had received a fair trial and were guilty. In August 1927, after many appeals, Sacco and Vanzetti were executed. Their trial showed how divided Americans could be when the i values held by most people conflicted with the rights of those in the I minority. Other groups also were the targets of prejudice during the 1920's. Many Americans were prejudiced against Jews, Catholics, and blacks and often discriminated against them. Many blacks had moved from the [ South to cities in the North, Middle West, and West during World War Who were Sacco and Vanzetti? What happened to them? Clarence Darrow (left) and William Jennings Bryan (right) take a break during the Scopes Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, in 1925. Darrow defended school teacher John Scopes, and Bryan led the prosecution in a trial that became a national sensation. The basic issue concerned what could or could not be taught in public schools. The trial pointed up the conflicting life-styles of the 1920's. When else did varying life-styles conflict in the 1920's? Life in the Twenties 521 What caused the rise of a new Ku Klux Klan? What brought about its decline? What immigration laws were passed in the 1920's? What were their provisionst I. They were viewed with mistrust and fear by many whites. During the war and right after'it, attacks on blacks led to riots in such cities as Houston, East St. Louis, Chicago, Omaha, and Knoxville. Some blacks were killed, among them several World War I veterans, still in uniform. A new Ku Klux Klan had been organized in 1915. It spoke out against blacks, Catholics, Jews, and foreigners. By 1924, the Klan claimed nearly 5 million members and was powerful in several state governments. The Klan used threats and violence against those who opposed it. It went after black business owners who might compete with white-owned businesses. It sometimes forced Japanese and Chinese people on the West Coast to sell their land at low prices. Its members wore masks at their public meetings so others would not know who they were. When some states passed laws forbidding masks, the Klan lost members. Publicity and government investigations into Klan activities also led to a loss of members. By 1930, its membership had fallen to less than 30,000. 2.3 Closing the Door. The growth of intolerance and fear led the United States to a new immigration policy. In 1921, Congress passed a law which set up a quota (a certain number) for people who wanted to move to the United States. It limited the number of new immigrants Immigration laws in 1921 and 1924 set quotas. After the 1921 law was passed, some business leaders worked to loosen restrictions to allow more unskilled labor into the United States. How did both laws immediately affect total immigration?

The new law, however, still did not please some people in Congress. In 1910, a great many eastern and southern Europeans had been living in the United States. Because of this, the 1921 law allowed a large number of people from those areas to enter the United States. In 1924. Congress passed a new law. It cut the quota to 2 percent and changed the year on which it was based to 1890. That year, fewer people from eastern and southern Europe had been living in the United States. The law also barred all Asian immigrants. Until this time, the wives and children of Japanese immigrants had been allowed to enter the United States under the Gentlemen's Agreement. In 1929, the National Origins Act was passed. It said that only 150.000 immigrants could enter the United States each year. The number of people allowed from each country was based on the number from the area living in the United States in 1920. The 1924 law had led to a shortage of workers on sugar plantations and farms. But the problem was taken care of in part by Filipino immigrants. They did not fall under the immigration laws because the Philippines were an American possession. By 1930, there were about 45.000 Filipinos in the United States and another 63,000 in Hawaii. 2.4 The Struggle for Civil and Political Rights. Even with the intolerance shown by some Americans in the 1920's, gains still were made in the area of rights. Women, for example, had played an important part in the war effort. Partly because of this, many people pushed harder for women's suffrage. In 1919, Woodrow Wilson had asked Congress to amend the Constitution to give women the right to vote. In 1920, Congress passed and the states ratified the Nineteenth Amendment. It gave women that right. In 1924, Congress passed an act that made citizens of all Indians living in the United States. The bill had been written by Senator Charles Curtis of Kansas. Curtis had Kaw and Osage Indian heritage. The act applied only to one third of the Indians, however. The other two thirds were already citizens. Some had become citizens through treaties or the Dawes Act of 1887. Others had done so by marrying citizens or by joining the armed services during World War I. Once Indians became citizens, they were subject to local laws and to taxes. In the past, citizenship had caused many Indians to lose their lands because they could not pay their property taxes. This, plus a fear they would lose many of their traditions and ways of life, led some Indians to try to stop Curtis' bill from becoming law. Eight Indian groups protested to Congress and later to the League of Nations. In the What gains in rights were made in the 7920's > What bill was sponsored by Senator Curtis? Why did some Indians not want Curtis' bill passed? Life in the Twenties 523 What conditions did Mexican Americans face after World War If What did they doi end, their protests did no good. All Indians living in the United States became citizens. World War I had made many Americans more aware of their country and the opportunities it had to offer as well as its problems. This was especially true for Mexican Americans and blacks. Many of them had served as soldiers and worked in arms factories during World War I. Because of this, they expected to be treated as well as other Americans. After the war, however, Mexican Americans found that many jobs were closed to them. Those jobs that were open did not offer any chance to move to better jobs. At the same time, new immigrants from Mexico kept arriving. This meant more competition for unskilled jobs. As a result, Mexican Americans who could not find the jobs they wanted usually ended up working for low pay, many as farm laborers. In time, some Mexican Americans began to help others learn more about their political and legal rights. In 1921, the Order of the Sons of America was founded in San Antonio, Texas. It worked through political action to gain greater educational opportunities for people of Spanish and Mexican backgrounds. The Order and groups like it were at work in other areas that had large numbers of Mexican Americans. Blacks ran into many of the same problems as Mexican Americans. For some blacks, the end of the war meant a loss of jobs when returning Women in the I920's demanded equal rights as American citizens (left). Many women gained job rights through the actions of professional and trade unions (right). What constitutional right did women win in 1920? 524 Life in the Twenties What part of the economy did not prosper? How and why did Mellon support business? What was the most serious strike of 1919? What was the American Plan? Some parts of the economy did not do as well as others, however. Farmers had produced large quantities of food during World War I. Tile end of the wartime demand and the changing diet of Americans caused problems for farmers. While business boomed, agriculture did not. 3.3 Protecting American Business. While the economy was doing well, business people became more popular. The government did all it could to protect business interests. The Fordney-McCumber Tariff, for example, was passed in 1922. It raised tariff rates to protect American business from competition from other countries. Business had friends in the federal government. One of them was Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury from 1921 to 1930. Mellon helped to have laws passed that lowered taxes for corporations and lor the wealthy. Mellon believed that this would help the economy by freeing more money for investments, The government also helped business in other ways. Neither the ICC, the Justice Department, nor the courts actively worked to see that laws against trusts and monopolies were obeyed. Because of this, there were a great many mergers. This was the joining together of two or more companies to form a larger company. In manufacturing and mining alone, around 8,000 companies were taken over in this way. 3.4 Holding Down American Labor. Business fared well during the 1920's, but labor unions did not. Because workers were badly needed for the war effort during World War I, the government had backed their efforts to organize. Wages rose, and the number of workers in the AFT grew from 2 million to 4 million. Once the war was over, businesses wanted to hold down costs. Government at all levels took the side of business. By 1919, there was serious trouble between business and labor. That year, nearly 4 million workers took part in strikes or work-stoppages. The most serious strike began in September 1919 in the steel industry. Nearly 275,000 steel workers walked off their jobs. The number grew to around 350,000. To help crush the strike, the steel companies tried to scare many workers who were recent immigrants The steel companies told these workers that if they did not go back to work, they would lose their jobs to other immigrants. The steel companies also took out newspaper ads in many languages, all of which said that striking was un-American. The companies also hired strikebreakers to take the place of many workers. Local police and state militias broke up workers' meetings. Because of all this, the steel strike finally was crushed. When the steel strike failed, other business leaders also began to fight the unions. Many of them used a system they called the American 530 Life in the Twenties Arthur Rothstein photographed this Oklahoma farmer and his two children fleeing a dust storm in 1936. What caused these dust bowl conditions over much of the southern Great Plains? How did the government try to cut down the number of people needing relief? California. But even with state and local help, there were too many people, too little money, and too few jobs. Federal and state governments wanted to cut down the number of people seeking jobs or needing relief. Some people thought one way to do this was by sending Mexicans who were living in the United States back to Mexico. Between 1930 and 1940, more than 250,000 Mexicans were returned to Mexico. Most of the adults were Mexican citizens. But many of the children had been born in the United States and were American citizens. To further help American workers without jobs, several members of Congress wanted to restrict immigration from other countries. To do this, Congress passed the Tydings-McDuffie bill in 1934. It called for Philippine independence in ten years. It also said that only 50 Filipinos could enter the United States each year. The act proved unnecessary, however. During the years of the depression, more people left the United States than came into it as immigrants. 1.4 Hoover and the Depression. When the stock market crashed in 1929, Herbert Hoover had been President for a little over six months. Like many Americans, Hoover felt the American economy 544 The Depression and the New Deal Between 1933 and 1938, the United States also took part in meetings with several Latin American countries. During these, it was agreed that no country had the right to intervene in the affairs of another. It was also decided that the United States and Latin American countries would work together if threatened by war. In what countries did dictatorships arise in the 1920's and 1930's? What was Mussolini's goal? What was Hitler's goal? Who did Hitler blame for Germany's problems? What did he do to them? 1.2 The Rise of Dictatorships. The United States wanted to be on good terms with Latin American countries. The reason for this had to do with changes taking place in the governments of some other countries. The United States was afraid that the time might come when all the nations of the Western Hemisphere would have to band together against one or more of these countries. Italy and Germany, for example, each was ruled by a dictatorship—a form of government in which one person (a dictator) or a small group of people hold all power. Both Italy and Germany were ruled by single dictators. After World War I, the Italian economy was in a depression. Many Italians felt that their country had not been rewarded properly for what it had done in the war. Benito Mussolini and his Fascist party promised to restore the economy and make Italy a great world power. Many Italians were willing to support them. By 1922, Mussolini had taken over the Italian government. He wanted Italy to have the power and glory it had had as the center of the Roman Empire. Mussolini set out to build an Italian empire in the Mediterranean and Africa. In 1935, the Italian army invaded and took over the African country of Ethiopia. Two years before Italy took over Ethiopia, Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist party (or Nazi party) had gained control of the government of Germany. Hitler had become chancellor, or prime minister, of Germany. He had taken advantage of the country's economic problems and the bitter feeling about the Versailles Treaty to win over the people and become dictator. He promised to make Germany strong and to build it again into a great military power. He also promised to get back land Germany had lost after World War I. Hitler blamed Germany's problems on the Jews. He told the German people that Jews controlled the banks and had caused the depression. Under Hitler, laws were passed that took away most legal rights of German Jews. All Jews had to wear yellow stars on their clothing so everyone would know they were Jews. In time, the Nazis began to round up Jews and put them, as well as others, into prison camps, called concentration camps. More than 6 million Jews were killed. Hitler's long-range plan was to get rid of all Jews in Europe. In 1936, the German army marched into the Rhineland, an area between France and Germany. This went against the terms of the Versailles Treaty. It was the first step in Hitler's plan to rule Europe. 564 World War II OCEAx INlHfcS shipped to countries at war.

As early as 1931, Japan invaded aggression? Manchuria. Then in 1937, Japan began a major war against China. The Japanese army took over large areas of land and many major Chinese cities. Meanwhile, Italy attacked and then annexed the nearby count!) of Albania in 1939. Germany began its aggression, or attacks on others, in 1938. That year, the German army occupied Austria, which then became a part of The Axis Powers reached the height of their expansion by 1942.

Who was opposed to giving aid to countries at war? Why? What was the purpose of Lend-Lease? For several months, things were quiet. Then in early 1940, the Germans launched large-scale attacks on countries in western Europe. Both Denmark and Norway fell to the Germans. In May, the Germans swept through Belgium and the Netherlands and on into France. The French had not expected the Germans to attack from the north. Their army remained grouped at their Maginot Line. This was a line of fortifications built along the eastern border of France. Even though the French army was large, it was beaten by June. Some of the French and British forces in France managed to escape. More than 300,000 British and French were evacuated, or withdrawn, from Dunkirk to England. 1.5 Lend-Lease and Defense Preparations. By 1939, Americans had become alarmed at the German, Italian, and Japanese victories. On September 8, President Roosevelt asked Congress to allow the United States to ship arms to countries at war. Two months later, the Neutrality Act of 1939 was passed, repealing part of the 1935 act. It allowed the United States to supply arms to countries at war. The United States and Great Britain worked out an agreement the following year. In it, the United States agreed to give Great Britain50 destroyers. In return, Great Britain gave the United States the right to lease certain British-controlled naval and air bases in the Caribbean. The United States also began to build up its own armed forces. President Roosevelt and Congress wanted the country to be ready in case of enemy attack. To make sure there were enough soldiers. Congress passed a bill in September 1940 creating the first peacetime draft in the history of the United States. The American army which had only 170,000 soldiers in 1939 soon grew to over 1 million. By this time, Americans were divided over the question of giving aid to the countries at war. General Robert E. Wood organized the America First Committee. It spoke out against American involvement. This and several others like it were supported by such well-known Americans as Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford. Other Americans did not agree with them. They backed groups such as the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies. It had been founded by Kansas newspaper editor William Allen White. Against this background, the election of 1940 took place. In it, the Democrats nominated Roosevelt for a third term. The Republicans chose Wendell Willkie, a lawyer from Indiana. Roosevelt easily won the election. In his message to Congress in January 1941, Roosevelt suggested a policy he called Lend-Lease. He wanted the United States to give more aid to Great Britain. But the British were running out of money to buy war materials, and the Neutrality Acts said the United States could not make loans to countries at war. In March 1941, the 568 World War II Where did the British stop Rommel's advance? What were the functions of the At the same time, some German forces were fighting in eastern Europe, others were helping the Italians fight in North Africa.

That month, the British finally stopped Rommel's offensive at El Alamein, near Alexandria. Egypt. 1. What battle stopped the Japanese advance across the Central Pacific? 2. How far did the Axis forces advance in eastern Europe? 3. The Home Front__________________________________________ World War I had seemed like a big war, but World War II was even bigger. This time the United States had to prepare to fight a war on many fronts. Americans had to fight Germany and Italy in Africa and Europe at the same time they were fighting Japan in the Pacific. Once again, the United States was called upon for much-needed supplies not only for Americans, but for soldiers and sailors of many Allied countries as well. Just as the effects of World War I were felt by nearly even American on the home front, so were those of World War II. 3.1 Mobilizing for War. Even before the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States government had begun taking steps to ready the American economy for war. Once the country was in the war, agencies were set up to order the economy and to see that war materials were produced. In January 1942, the War Production Board (WPB)was set up. Headed by Donald M. Nelson, it decided which war materials would be produced. It also made sure war industries received the supplies they needed. That same month, the Emergency Price Control Act was passed. It formed the Office of Price Administration (OPA) to set prices on all goods except those from farms. The OPA also set controls on the cost of rents in areas where there were defense plants. The OPA also began rationing, or setting limits on the amount of certain goods people could buy. Automobile tires had been rationed the year before by another agency. The OPA rationed sugar, coffee, gasoline, and fuel oil in 1942. In 1943, it added meat, fats and oils, butter, cheese, and processed foods to the list. A year later, it added shoes. Besides setting up agencies to take care of the economy, the federal government also took other steps to prepare for war. One of the first things it did was to provide more people for the armed services. Thousands of young men were drafted under the 1941 law. In 572 World War II How much did World War II cost the United States? What Americans were hurt most by intolerance during the war? What did the Supreme Court rule in Korematsu v. United States? workers, either. Thousands of women began working as welders, riveters, and in many other jobs. 3.3 Financing the War. Like World War I, World War II cost the United States a great dea\ of money—ovei SSOObWWon. Ways had to be found to raise the money. The government got about 40 percent of it by increasing taxes. Citizens and businesses both had to pay higher taxes. The government also held a series of bond sales much like those of World War I. These sales brought in nearly $100 billion. 3.4 Problems for Japanese Americans. The success of the Axis countries did more than make Americans prepare for war. It also led many Americans to fear and hate people from Axis countries who were living in the United States. Hurt most by this were people of Japanese background. More than 100,000 Japanese Americans lived on the West Coast of the United States. Many people there, some of them public officials, were afraid that the Japanese Americans would help Japan if it attacked the United States. These people began to demand that people of Japanese background be moved from the West Coast. In February 1942, President Roosevelt ordered the army to move some 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry from their homes to relocation centers (camps) in California, Arizona, Wyoming, Utah, Arkansas, and Idaho. They had to sell their homes and belongings, often at a loss. A great many of those relocated were American citizens In a 1944 case, Korematsu v. United States, the Supreme Court held that the relocation program was constitutional under the war poweRot the President. However, the Court later ruled that a person whose loyalty had been proved could not be held. During the war, more than 17,000 Japanese Americans fought for the United States. Japanese Americans formed the 442nd Regimental Combat Team. With their motto "Go for Broke," they were the most decorated combat force in the United States Army. 1.

The Road to Victory________________________________________ By late 1942 and early 1943, the huge industrial production of the United States began to have an effect. The tide of the war began to turn in favor of the Allies. Slowly, American and other Allied forces went on the offensive. By 1944, they were well on the road to victory. 574 World War II 1920's, and half a million more Americans came to Los Angeles, many of them by automobile. Houses began to fill the valleys and climb the hillsides. During the depression, droughts, and dust storms of the 1930's, thousands of people moved to California from central, southern, and eastern states. Many of them hoped that Los Angeles would be their "Promised Land." Some of these people found work in the oil and shipping industries. Sunkist, one of California's citrus fruit industries, offered jobs to others. A Mixture of Backgrounds By 1940, more than 1.5 million people lived in Los Angeles. Most of them were "newcomers." Only a handful of the inhabitants are defended from pioneer Mexican and American families. Only a small number of adult Angelenos [citizens of Los Angeles] were born in the city. The majority of the inhabitants have come here in recent years, mostly from the Middle West. ... In addition to American settlers, Los Angeles has attracted immigrants of many races. . . . Mexicans, Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos. More black Americans were also seeking that "Promised Land" found in the job market of Los Angeles. The wartime prosperity that brought more people to the city uncovered old problems of prejudice and created new ones. There were pressures of competition for jobs and for housing. Japanese Americans When the Japanese bornbed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, feelings for the Japanese American population in Los Angeles changed. The Anglo-American citizens became frightened. They began to distrust all Japanese. Editorials in local newspapers referred to California as a "danger zone." The Japanese were rounded up from their homes and moved to relocation camps. After the war, many of them returned to find their homes and businesses gone. A few received some government payment for what they had lost. Full repayment, however, was never made. S. J. Oki, a Japanese American who had been moved to a camp, reported: Objectively, and on the whole, life in a relocation center is not unbearable. There are dust-storms and mud. Housing is inadequate, with families of six living in single rooms in many cases. Food is below the standard set for prisoners of war. In some of the camps Los Angeles is known to many as a city of freeways. How has the automobile affected the environment and growth of the city? Los Angeles 591 Beginning in April 1942, about 110,000 Japanese Americans-—half of them under 20 years old—were ordered to relocation centers. Why did this happen? hospitals are at times understaffed and supplies meager. . . , What is not so bearable lies much deeper. . . . Their faces look bewildered as they stare at the barbed-wire fences and [guard] towers that surround the camp. Their eyes ask: Why? Why? What is all this? Kats Ento, who had been a farmer, wrote: I am an American citizen. I was born and brought up in California. / have never been outside the United Slates, and I don't know Japan or what Japan stands for. But because my parents [did not give] me blue eyes, reddish hair, and a high nose, I am here in camp [held] without the formality of a charge, to say nothing of a trial. Does the Constitution say only white men are created equal? Mr. Yokida was a 65-year-old farmer who had lived in California for 40 years. He said: For forty years l worked in central and southern California, lean remember when Los Angeles was only a small town. . . . This country never gave me citizenship, but I never went back to Japan and I have no interests there. The evacuation has worked a hardship on me and my family, but I suppose in time of war you have to stand for a lot of hardships. . . . The Zoot-Suiters The Japanese were not the only group facing discrimination. Some Mexican Americans were having problems with the Los Angeles police. They were being characterized as a violent people and were not permitted into many of the public parks, swimming pools, theaters, dance halls, and restaurants. Some Mexican American young people joined together into groups. Their symbol of unity was an outfit called a "zoot suit." It included a flat hat with a wide brim and a long, loose, wide-shouldered coat worn over pans that were pleated and high-waisted with pegged or tight cuffs. A long key chain hanging from the pocket of the pants was usually part of the outfit. In the spring of 1943, riots broke out between these "zoot-suiters" and soldiers who were waiting to go overseas. The federal government feared that the riots were being used as propaganda against the United States. It insisted that military police settle the trouble quickly. Military passes were can- celled, and strict controls were placed on soldiers and sailors. The street fighting gradually stopped, and order was restored. 592 Los Angeles Kt MAMA Mile* Ki tome ten Communism, 1955 In 1955. communism was confined to Europe and Asia.

During World War II, they had stood together against the Japanese. With Japan's surrender, however, civil war broke out again in 1947. In this war, the Soviet Union backed the Communists, while the United States aided the Nationalists. However, the Nationalists steadily lost ground. By 1949, the Communists had driven them from the mainland to the island of Formosa (Taiwan). On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was set up under Mao Tse-tung. Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and i several other countries recognized Mao Tse-tung's new government. Fie United States, however, refused to do so and continued to recognize Chiang Kai-shek's government. The Soviet Union wanted Mao Tse-tung's government to represent China in the UN. When the United States blocked this, the Soviet Union boycotted the Security Council. When was Communist China established? |v. 1 Cold War and Crisis 605 SI.25 an hour over two years. More people were covered by social security. In May 1961, the Area Redevelopment Act was passed. It provided for loans and federal grants to areas of the country with many poor people and few jobs. In June 1963, the Higher Education Facilities Act was passed. It gave colleges money to improve their buildings or construct new ones. One area in which Congress was very interested was the space program. Americans began to think more about outer space in 1957. That year, the Soviet Union launched the first successful satellite—a small object circling a planet—to orbit the earth. It was called Sputnik I. This was a blow to the United States. It led many Americans to fear that the Soviet Union had more scientific knowledge than did the United States. Because of this, the National Defense Education Act was passed in 1958. It gave colleges and college students federal money for studies in science and languages. That same year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was set up to direct the American space program. When President Kennedy took office, he announced that he wanted Americans to land a person on the moon before 1970. That goal was reached by Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin in 1969. On July 20, Armstrong became the first human to step on the moon. As he did so, he said "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." Millions of people around the world watched the event on live television. 1.3 The Growth of Black Civil Rights. When Kennedy took office, he hesitated to push hard for civil rights for blacks. He thought that if he did, he would lose support for other important programs. Still, while Kennedy was in office, some steps were taken that helped blacks. In 1962, against the wishes of the governor of Mississippi, the Supreme Court ordered that James Meredith, a black student, be allowed to enter the University of Mississippi. That year, Kennedy banned discrimination in housing built or bought with federal aid. With the backing of both the President and his brother, Attorney-General Robert Kennedy, the Department of Justice worked tocarry out the Civil Rights Laws of 1957 and 1960. It brought 50 court suits in four southern states to get voting rights for blacks. The actions taken by Kennedy and the government came about in large part because of pressure from blacks. Black leaders wanted Congress and the American people to know they opposed segregation and discrimination. They organized and held demonstrations—public displays of feelings by a group toward a policy, a cause, or a person—in veral cities. In August 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., and other black What Soviet achievement was a blow to American prestige? Who was the first person on the moon? What gains in civil rights were made during the Kennedy administration? Years of Hope and Tension 623 President Johnson also worked to pass Kennedy's civil rights law. In 1964, he succeeded. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 made it illegal to discriminate against people in the use of such public places as hotels, eating places, and parks. It also outlawed discrimination in any program that received money from the federal government. The act further said that a person could not be refused a job because of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. To check into and judge complaints, the act set up the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). How did the civil rights movement change in the 7960's? What was the Kerner Commission? What were its findings? What new approach was advocated by some black leaders in the 1960's? How did it differ? 2.2 The Changing Black Rights Movement. The federal government was working to help blacks through legislation. At the same time, the black movement itself was changing. During the 1950's, blacks had been concerned mostly with voting rights and school segregation in the South. In the 1960's, they began to turn their attention to the North. Many blacks there felt that the civil rights movement was doing little for them. As northern blacks became more frustrated, riots broke out in black neighborhoods. In 1964, there were riots in the Harlem area of New York City and in the Watts area of Los Angeles. The Watts riot lasted for six days. During that time, 35 people were killed, and 800 were hurt. Buildings were looted and set on fire. Businesses were attacked. Many blacks, as well as whites, lost all they owned. Before long, riots also broke out in other large northern cities. In Detroit, Michigan, one left 40 people dead, 2,000 hurt, and 5,000 without homes. President Johnson set up a commission headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner. It was to find out what was causing the riots. The Kerner Commission reported that they were brought on by frustration over bad housing, crowded conditions, not enough jobs, and the general lack of opportunity. It also said that instead of moving toward equality, the gap between whites and blacks was growing wider. Black leaders differed on the way to deal with the situation. In March 1965, Martin Luther King led blacks and whites in a five-day march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. They were protesting violence and discrimination against blacks. In 1966, King began a drive for open housing in Chicago. Some other black leaders tried a different approach to improve conditions. Stokely Carmichael, head of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, coined the phrase "black power." It became a popular slogan, expressing an increased push for full rights. Black power, however, did not mean the same things to all people. To some.it meant electing black officials, having a greater voice in community decisions, and teaching and learning more about black culture and 630 Years of Hope and Tension Chien Shiung Wu (1912- ) Graciela Olivarez (1928- More women worked outside the home during the 1950's and 1960's than during any previous decade. Job discrimination based on sex lessened. Yet, it was still rare to find many women in specialized fields. Chien Shiung Wu in physics and Graciela Olivarez in government were two people who overcame restrictions on women and on members of minority groups. Chien Shiung Wu was born in Liu Ho, China. When she was 24, she moved to the United States. At the University of California at Berkeley, Wu earned a doctorate in physics. She taught at Smith College and Princeton University before going to Columbia University in 1952. Wu won many distinctions for her research in nuclear forces. She was recognized, in particular, for her work in disproving the principle of parity. Accepted as a universal principle for 30 years, parity maintained that in nature, there is no difference between a right and a left side. In 1976, Wu became president of the American Physical Society. Her awards have come from the National Academy of Sciences and from 12 universities. Graciela Olivarez was born in Phoenix, Arizona. Her father was Spanish, and her mother was Mexican. Olivarez quit school at age 15 to take a job. She was a secretary for a short time before becoming a radio announcer. Her "action line" program helped people who had problems with government and businesses. This work led her into community service work as state antipoverty director in Arizona. Olivarez recognized that she needed further education to be more effective in helping other people. Even though she did not finish high school, Notre Dame University offered her a scholarship. In 1970, Olivarez became the first woman graduate of Notre Dame Law School. For a while, Olivarez taught law and directed the Institute of Social Research and Development at the University of New Mexico. In March 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Olivarez head of the national Community Services Administration. The successes of Wu and Olivarez show the possibilities that exist for the United States to use the skills and talents of all its people.

To others, however, it meant the setting up of all-black communities. In 1968, Martin Luther King went to Memphis, Tennessee, to support a sanitation workers' strike. While there, he was shot and killed by James Earl Ray. Without King's leadership, the civil rights movement began to lose its unity and effectiveness. 2.3 The Mexican American Rights Movement. Mexican Americans also began to push for more rights in the 1960's. Along with others of Spanish origin, they made up the second largest minority group in the country. In the 1950's, the Community Service Organization (CSO) had worked to get Mexican Americans in the Los Angeles area to register to vote. Other groups, such as the Mexican-American Political Association, worked to elect Mexican Americans to political offices. C6sar Chavez was an early leader of the CSO. In 1963, Chavez helped organize the National Farm Workers' Association. The group joined the AFL-CIO in 1966 and became known as the United Farm Workers. Its members wanted the right to bargain for higher pay and better working conditions. They led strikes and boycotts against large companies that grew lettuce and grapes. Other groups also were formed by Mexican Americans during the 1960's. The Alianza was begun in New Mexico by Reies L6pez Tijerina. It worked mostly to gain back deeds to Spanish and Mexican lands lost to the federal government. The Crusade for Justice was formed in Colorado by Rodolfo Gonzales. It tried to gain more civil rights for Cesar Chavez leads a group of people in support of the National Farm Workers' Association. The farm workers' motto was "huelga," a Spanish word for strike. They marched in groups to show their unity and strength. What did Chavez help to accomplish for Mexican American farm workers? 632 Years of Hope and Tension Mexican Americans. In 1970, a new political party called La Raza Unida was set up in Texas by Josd Angel Gutierrez. 2.4 Expanding the Program. While Mexican Americans and other groups were trying to help themselves. President Johnson was working to make life better for all Americans. Between 1965 and 1968, he was able to get many new programs through Congress. One was the Elementary and Secondary School Act of 1965. It gave $1.3 billion to schools on the basis of the number of needy children in each district. This was the first large-scale federal aid ever given to schools. The Higher Education Act of 1965 allowed federal money for college scholarships for the first time. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 did away with literacy tests as a means of deciding who could vote. It also gave federal officers the power to register people to vote in areas where local authorities were keeping them from doing so. A new medical insurance was added to the social security program in 1965. One part, called Medicare, helped people 65 and over pay their medical bills. Another part, called Medicaid, helped low-income families pay theirs. A new Cabinet office was also set up in 1965. Called the Department .of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), it was headed by Robert Weaver. He was the first black Cabinet Secretary in the federal government. The Model Cities Act of 1966 gave cities money to rebuild run-down areas and to pay for city planning. The Open Housing Law of 1966 made it against the law to discriminate in the sale or rental of housing. More acts were passed in 1968. They gave the states money to improve their law enforcement and criminal justice agencies. They provided low-income families with places to live. They also set aside land for national parks and called for the cleaning up of polluted air and water. In three years, President Johnson had pushed through more programs than any other President before him except Franklin Roosevelt. 2.5 New Directions in Immigration. As President, Johnson also turned his attention to the country's immigration policy. Immigration patterns had been changing in the United States since the end of World War II. At that time, several special acts had been passed to allow displaced persons—those who have been forced to leave their country because of political reasons—to enter the United States. Some 400,000 Europeans came into the country under the Displaced Persons Act of 1948. In 1952, the McCarran-Walter Act lifted the ban against Asian and Pacific peoples. That same year, Puerto Rico became a United States commonwealth—a country with local self-government but united under another country. In time, nearly How was education helped under the Johnson administration? Who was the first black Cabinet Secretary? What major groups of people came into the United States in the late 1940's and 1950's? Years of Hope and Tension 633 500.000 Puerto Ricans entered the United States. The next year, the Refugee Relief Act was passed. Under it, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Communist areas came to the United States. Over 20.000 Hungarians came in under the act in 1956. They fled their homeland after a Soviet invasion put down a revolt against the Hungarian Communist government in power. The new immigration law passed in 1965 under Johnson changed the old quota system which favored western and northern European immigrants. It limited the number of people who could enter the United States each year from the Western Hemisphere to 120,000. It also did away with the limit for each country. It set the number of people who could enter from the Eastern Hemisphere at 170,000. No more than 20.000 could enter from any eastern country. 1. How did Lyndon Johnson become President? 2. What were the main provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? 3. What groups were organized to work for the civil rights of Mexican Americans? 4. According to revised immigration laws, how many people could enter the United States each year? 3. The Strain of Intervention Why did the United States intervene in the Dominican Republic in 7965? When President Johnson took office, American foreign policy still was aimed at keeping communism from spreading. Because of this, the United States became involved in many different parts of the world during the Johnson years. This, in turn, put a great strain on American relations with other countries and on the unity of the American people. 3.1 Intervention in the Caribbean. One area where the United States became involved was the Caribbean. In April 1965, there was a revolt in the Dominican Republic. President Johnson ordered more than 20,000 American troops into the area. He claimed that Communists were trying to set up a Communist dictatorship there. This, he felt, gave the United States the right of intervention—to interfere in the affairs of another nation. Many people in the United States, as well as most Latin Americans, did not agree. They said the United States should not have acted without first talking it over with Latin American leaders. Also, many people felt there was not enough evidence of Communist involvement to make such an action necessary. 634 Years of Hope and Tension lead to nuclear war. There was also agreement for the two countries to work together in the areas of business, science, and culture. 4.3 A New China Policy. At the same time. President Nixon was also trying to improve relations with the People's Republic of China. The Chinese invited an American ping-pong team to visit the People's Republic of China in April 1971. Three months later, Nixon announced that he would visit that country the following year. He said he was going there to seek normalization—a return to normal conditions—of relations between the two countries. In September, the United States recommended to the United Nations that the People's Republic of China be allowed to become a member. The People's Republic of China took over the seat in the United Nations which had been held by the Republic of China (Taiwan). On February 21,1972, President Nixon became the first American President to visit the People's Republic of China. He met with Premier Chou En-lai and Chairman Mao Tse-tung. They agreed to set up closer trade and other relations between the two countries. Nixon signed a declaration that said Taiwan was legally part of mainland China. It also said that in time, American forces would leave there, and that Taiwan's future would be decided by the Chinese themselves. This, more than anything, showed how much United States policy toward China had changed under President Nixon. This policy was continued in the How did American policy toward China change? When did Nixon first visit China? What was accomplished by the visit? President Nixon stands on the Great Wall of China, not far from Peking, during his 1972 visit to the People's Republic.

Who was hard hit by Reaganomics? political lobby to push their ideas in Congress and worked to defeat liberal candidates running for office. By 1982, however, many members were not completely satisfied with the President's performance. They felt Reagan had not worked hard enough to satisfy their demands. 4.3 The Blue-Collar Vote. Before 1980 most industrial workers and white ethnic groups had usually voted Democratic. These lower-middle- and middle-class voters, however, had been hard hit by high taxes, rising inflation, and growing unemployment in the late 1970's. Many felt that the Democrats had spent too much on social programs. They also wanted more emphasis placed on patriotism and national defense. Thus, they supported Reagan in 1980. But after two years, many blue-collar workers were no longer happy with Reaganomics. Unemployment had become a serious problem. Certain valued social programs had been scrapped, educational benefits reduced, and unemployment coverage lowered. There was even talk that social security was in serious difficulty. Thus, there was widespread dissatisfaction among blue-collar workers. 4.4 Minority Groups. Blacks and Hispanics were among the hardest hit by Reaganomics. Black unemployment was twice that of non-blacks, and in some cities unemployment of males between the ages of 16 and 35 was over 30 percent. Because many blacks and Hispanics were poor, the cuts in social programs also hurt them. Black members of Congress, as well as other minority group leaders, spoke out against the reduction of social services to little avail. 688 The New Federalism As it moved into the 1980's, the United States was just over 200 years old. In that time, the country, the people, and the ways of life had changed greatly. The story of the United States has been one of change and of meeting new challenges. In the years to come, there will be more changes—in society, in culture, and in the economy. These changes will continue to bring new challenges to America and Americans. 1. A Changing American Society____________________________________ Much has happened in the United States since the 1950's, and American society has had to change with the times. This can be seen in the wealth and well-being of the people, as well as in their problems. It also can be seen in their levels of education and their ideas. The very makeup of the people is different in the 1980's from the recent past. 1.1 The American People. The people of the United States always have been a mixed group, coming from every area of the world. This was still true as the nation entered the 1980's. According to the 1980 census, there were about 226.5 million Americans. Making up that number were 180.5 million whites, 26.5 million blacks, about 14.6 million Hispanics, 3.5 million Asian Americans, and about 1.4 million American Indians. As a whole, the American people make up one of the most prosperous nations in the world. The median family income of Americans was $3,319 a year in 1950. This means that one half of the families in America made more and one half made less than $3,319 that year. By 1980, the figure had risen to about $18,000. The gross national product (GNP)—the value of all goods and services produced in one year—also rose. In 1950, the GNP was $286 billion. In 1980, it was $2.5 trillion. Education is another area of change. The number of Americans able to go to college has grown greatly. Only 1.1 percent of people 18 to 24 years old were able to go to college in 1870. That year 52,000 Americans were working toward college degrees. In 1970, more than 32 percent could go to college, and close to 8 million were working toward degrees. At the same time, hundreds of thousands more were taking college courses for which they would receive no degree. 1.2 Population Change and Mobility. Americans as a people not only have become more prosperous and more educated, they also have changed in other ways. Even though the population has kept growing, its rate of growth has declined. For every ten Americans born Into what groups is the American population broken down by the Census Bureau? How much did median family income increase between 1950 and 1980? How many more people go to college today than did 100 years ago? What is happening to the rate of population growth? Why? Challenges for America 693 Population by State, 1980 In 1980. which slates had the largest number of people? Which states had the smallest? Which section of the United States was most populated? Which section was least populated? How has immigration changed in recent years? in 1915, only eight were born in I960, only six in 1970, and only five in 1980. As far as experts can tell, the rate will keep on going down in the years ahead. As the birthrate has gone down, so has the proportion of young people. In 1970, the median age of Americans was just over 28. In 1979, it rose to 30. By the year 2(XM), it is expected to be about 35. Some of the changes in population are due to a change in immigration. In America's early years, a great many people came to 694 Challenges for America settle. Since quotas on immigration were passed in the 1920's, fewer immigrants have entered the country. So immigrants have contributed less to population growth. In the 1970's, for example, over 80 percent of all Americans had been born in the United States, and so had their parents. The home countries of more recent immigrants are different, too. In the past, most immigrants came from Europe. In the 1970's, the largest number came from Mexico and the Philippines. Many also came from the West Indies and India, as well as Vietnam and other areas of Southeast Asia. Another factor that has made a difference in American society is the people's mobility, or ability to move or be moved. Americans always have been a people on the move. During the 1800's, they moved in great numbers from east to west and from rural to urban areas. In the 1950's, people began moving from the cities to the suburbs in search of more space, better schools, less crime, and lower taxes. By 1980, more Americans lived in suburbs than in central city areas. The movement to the suburbs has caused hardships for many cities. Most of the people who left the cities were white and had good incomes. When they moved away, they left the central cities occupied mostly by the poor, the aged, and minorities, many of whom could not find jobs. They needed the social services provided by the cities. But as the need Why did people move to the suburbsf What problems were caused by the move to the suburbs? How did total American population change from 1930 until 1980? What percent of the total population does each foreign nationality group make up? What can account for the site of the total foreign-born population? Population Growth, 1930-1980_____________________ Population (in millions) 150 ------------------------- 130 ------------------------- 210 -------------------------- Total Estimated Population, 1980 Foreign Born 4.5 % Italian Born .5% 1.009.000 German Born .4% 833.000 Canadian Born.4% 812.000 Mexican Born 760.000 British Born .3% 686.000 Polish Born .2% 548.000 Other 2.1% 4.648.000 Challenges for America 695 How many Americans are poor? On the whole, what group of Americans are the poorest? Why was AIM formedI for these services grew, the cities found that they were less able to provide them. What to do about this is one of the most important questions facing the United States. Hardest hit by the movement to the suburbs are the industrial cities of the Northeast and Middle West, such as New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Detroit. The entire northeast part of the country also has been losing people to the sun belt—the southeast and southwest parts where the weather is sunny and warm much of the time. In the 1960's, California moved ahead of New York as the state with the most people. By 1980, Los Angeles, San Diego, Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio were among the ten largest cities in the United States. At present, it is believed that the number of people in the sun belt will continue to grow. 1.3 The Problem of Poverty. Although the United States is a very prosperous nation, poverty is one of its major problems. More than 10 percent of the population (over 22.5 million Americans) live in poverty. In many cases, the poor are concentrated in certain areas of the country. One such area is Appalachia, a mountain region that stretches from New York to Georgia and Mississippi. Thousands of people there need better housing, medical treatment, and other services. The federal government has tried to help these people, and in some ways, it has succeeded. But much still remains to be done. Much poverty also exists among minority groups. The incomes of American Indians, blacks, and Hispanics as a whole are lower than that of whites. As a group, American Indians still are the poorest and least educated of all Americans. Blacks, too, have been hit hard. Throughout the 1970's, twice as many blacks as whites were unemployed. Most poor blacks lived in the inner cities where housing was bad, crime rates were high, and services were poor. 1.4 Seeking Equality. An awareness of the differences between their lives and those of other Americans led some groups to push for equality. During the 1960's and 1970's especially, minority groups and women organized and worked to achieve this goal. One group of people who stepped up their efforts during these years were American Indians. In 1968, they formed the American Indian Movement (AIM) to work for Indian rights. They wanted the Bureau of Indian Affairs to do more to end discrimination in jobs and in housing. They also wanted the Bureau to do more to protect water rights on Indian reservation land. In 1976, the Indians went a step further. More than 20 groups joined together to form a council. They hoped that by acting as one, they would have more say about the use of their land. 696 Challenges for America For what purposes have black and Hispanic artists used painting in recent years? to show a scene in a realistic way. Instead, more attention is paid to the act of creating the painting. This was best explained by Jackson Pollack, one of the style's creators. He said, "I want to express my feelings, rather than to illustrate them." During the late 1950's, another new American style of art appeared. Called Pop Art, its subjects were common, everyday things like soup cans and highway signs. These were painted with vivid colors and bold lines. Pop artist Andy Warhol became famous for his paintings of huge Campbell Soup cans. Another Pop artist, Roy Lichtenstein, gained fame for his comic-strip paintings. In the middle 1960's, still other American styles of art appeared. One called Minimal Art used designs and shapes to make colors seem like what they were not. Another was Super-Realism. Its subjects were painted in such a realistic way that it was easy to mistake the paintings for photographs. After the 1960's, many American artists began to use their paintings as a form of social protest. Black and Hispanic artists in particular created paintings that pointed out people's problems or Some people thought that Jackson Pollock (left) showed the rhythm and power of American life in his painting.

What is Abstract Expressionism? 700 Challenges for America Technicians at the Johnson Space Center follow the progress of a spacecraft on their monitors. When was Houston selected as the site for the space center? and others moved into the area. Houston became known as "Space City, U.S.A." The People of Houston A large number of the people living in Houston have come from other parts of Texas and the United States. Some have come from other countries. Since so many people of different cultures live in the city, organizations have been formed to help them. One example is the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). It was founded in the 1950's to help Mexican Americans, Latin Americans, and other Spanish-speaking citizens adjust to life in the United States. The major goal of the LULAC is to help stop discrimination and prejudice against these citizens. This is partly done by helping people find jobs and helping them learn English. The "School of 400" was started to help Spanish-speaking children learn at least 400 English words. The LULAC also gives scholarships to students going to college or technical school. Blacks in Houston in the 1960's and 1970's still worked at less-skilled, lower-pay- ing jobs and lived in the poorest housing in the city. But the growing awareness of the civil rights movement helped to improve people's lives in many ways. In 1980, two women and a Mexican American man were elected to Houston's city council for the first time. Two new black members were also elected to the council. Although there were still barriers, blacks and other minority groups began to advance professionally and politically. Taking the Opportunity The rise of Barbara Jordan to national prominence was one example of the new opportunities for women and blacks in the 1960's and 1970's. Born in Houston in 1936, Jordan is the daughter of a Baptist minister who also worked as a warehouse clerk. Jordan went through the segregated schools of Houston. She was an outstanding student at Texas Southern University and then attended Boston University Law School. Looking back on her childhood, Jordan said: When I was growing up, we didn't focus on being poor and black. Segregation was there. It was the way of life, and if you were fortunate and would just drive hard enough, you might be able to break out of it a little bit. In 1962, Jordan ran for the Texas House of Representatives and lost. She learned that "It was necessary to be backed by money, power, and influence." She commented: I considered abandoning the dream of a political career in Texas and moving to some section of the country where a black woman 714 Houston
